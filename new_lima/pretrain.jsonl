"available now:\nSDK support for .NET, Node, Python, Box CLI, and iOS. Box has expanded SDK support from Java to add additional server and mobile SDKs, including .NET, Python, Node, and iOS. Now developers can work with Box Sign APIs, in the language or environment of their choice, to build secure e-signature experiences into their in-house tools and custom integrations, as well as in their native mobile apps.\nBox Sign API for signer verification and password protection of docs. Box Sign has added API support for SMS-based two-factor authentication and for password-protection of documents sent for signature deliveries. Together, these APIs give an added layer of security to customers by helping to verify the identity of signers in third-party and custom applications, and enable customers to address use cases requiring additional authentication.\nNew and deepened integrations\nThis robust set of APIs, combined with SDK support and the rest of the Box platform, delivers a seamless experience for partners to integrate e-signature functionality directly into their systems instead of building a similar solution from scratch.\nFrom workflow automation to notarial services, partners such as UiPath and SIGNiX are already leveraging Sign API\u2019s to help joint customers save development time and enhance business productivity. For example, Box is also announcing the following new and deepened integrations:\nExpanded UiPath integration for Box Sign. As one of the most popular integrations for the UiPath platform, UiPath for Box already makes it easy for users and teams to leverage UiPath advanced technologies to automate processes that rely on files, data, or documents in Box. UiPath also plans to add Box Sign to UiPath Integration Service to help customers accelerate complex enterprise workstreams like contract processing, HR onboarding, and sales operations.\nBox Sign with SIGNiX for secure, remote online notarization.

But where are these subsequent Trump-like candidates who have run or will be running for political office that Generation Z is backing. More importantly, Generation Z was born and raised on multiculturalism steroids. They are liberal-moderate on social issues, but moderate-conservative on fiscal and security issues, fitting the mold of (gasp) a moderate Republican, or cuck. Perhaps Generation Z will be more conservative than Millennials, but they are not actively seeking out the GOP unless it takes steps to conform to their social views.\nCoconuts says\nI remember early in the last decade when I first started spending time in Belarus, being struck by the strength of various \u2018Enlightenment values\u2019 among the younger people I was talking to, then realising that it probably due to Soviet and legacy Soviet influence.

"I could ever be. I hold up this warped mirror made up of all these things, and I say to myself\u2026\nSo am I? The short answer is no. I\u2019m not. At least not in the context that many of us ask that question. Sure we may fail a task given to us. But in the context of the doubt and fear, we are not asking about a momentary state of realising we\u2019ve messed up in specific areas, we are asking about our identity. In a spiritual and mental sense it is as if they have taken one of those \u201cHello, I am\u201d stickers and in the blank space written \u201ca failure.\u201d They have then slapped that sticker firmly to their spirit and begun walking in that identity.\nBut that\u2019s never been the case. As a follower of Jesus Christ, our identity is so much more than that. Take a moment to look at these 4 verses.\nBut to all who did receive Him [Jesus], who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God,\nSee what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are.\nFor you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, \u201cAbba! Father!\u201d\nFor we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.\nJust in these four verses, we discover that as Christ followers we are given the right to become Children of God. We find that this identity as Children of God is a direct outgrowth of the love of God the Father. We discover that because of this love from our Father in Heaven, we have nothing to fear. We also see that this same loving Father considers us His workmanship or His pride and joy if you will.\nThe identity of being a \u201cChild of God\u201d is so much more than \u201cFailure.\u201d\nI think that some of the issues come about because we have forgotten something. We are in a long marathon called life, and our end goal is one thing, honour God. Stumbling will happen, and sometimes it happens a lot.\nIn Acts 20:24, the Apostle Paul speaks to this race.

"her to win this scholarship and what she is doing after graduation.\nReflections on the Stadelmann Scholarship\nBy Emma Bodiker\nIn the week leading up to graduation this past May, I had the incredible honor of being nominated to apply for the Stadelmann Scholarship. Each year, this scholarship is awarded to one senior in either the Kelley School of Business Department of Business Economics & Public Policy or the Department of Economics. We were each asked to reflect on how the study of economics has impacted us.\nEmma Bodiker\nReading the reflections of previous winners, I felt a bit intimidated by the task as I didn't have plans to pursue further economics education, research, or a career path that more closely aligned with my studies. However, as I began to think about the past four years, I found that my time in the Department has been just as invaluable to me as it is to anybody working directly in the field. This is evident in everything I do\u2014from the way I rationalize decisions on a daily basis to the critical thought I put into media consumption to the problem-solving I now do at my full-time job. Each of these things and more can be traced to teachable moments in lectures, meetings with professors, or conversations with classmates where I developed these important skills.\nI am now working at Epic Systems, a company who specializes in hospital database software, on the Business Intelligence application. Here, I am working with the tools that generate reports and predictive analyses to help hospitals make better decisions. Looking back, the opportunity to apply to the Stadelmann Scholarship not only gave me a deeper appreciation for the Department, its faculty, and my peers, but it helped me enter my career with a more profound understanding of how my education can be applied beyond the classroom.\nA final thank-you to everyone in the Department for making my time at Indiana University so worthwhile.\nDepartment Hosts Annual Awards Reception\nWe were delighted to host our annual awards reception the year in person on April 4, 2022.

"radius larger than 0.225 times the radius of the sphere-forming the structure\nRadius of a octahedral void \\(\\frac { r }{ R } \\) = 0.414\nWhat are point defects?\nIf the deviation occurs due to missing atoms, displaced atoms or extra atoms the imperfection is named as a point defect. Such defects arise due to imperfect packing during the original crystallisation or they may arise from thermal vibrations of atoms at elevated temperatures.\nExplain Schottky defect.\nThe schottky defect arises due to the missing of an equal number of cations and anions from the crystal lattice. This effect does not change the stoichiometry of the crystal. Ionic solids in which the cation and anion are of almost similar size show Schottky defect.\nExample: NaCl.\nPresence of large number of schottky defects in a crystal, lowers its density. For example, the theoretical density of vanadium monoxide (VO) calculated using the edge length of the unit cell is 6.5 g cm-3 but the actual experimental density is 5.6 gcm3. It indicates that there is approximately 14% Schottky defect in VO crystal. Presence of Schottky defect in the crystal provides a simple way by which atoms or ions can move within the crystal lattice.\nWrite short note on metal excess and metal deficiency defect with an example. Metal excess defect.\nMetal excess defect arises due to the presence of more number of metal ions as compared to anions.Alkali metal halides NaCl, KCl show this type of defect.The electrical neutrality of the crystal can be maintained by the presence of anionic vacancies equal to the excess metal ions (or) by the presence of extra cation and electron present in interstitial position.\nFor example, when NaCl crystals are heated in the presence of sodium vapour, Na+ ions are formed and are deposited on the surface of the crystal. Chloride ions (Cl\u2013) diffuse to the surface from the lattice point and combines with Na+ ion.\nThe electron lost by the sodium vapour diffuse into the crystal lattice and occupies the vacancy created"

My bottom front teeth were smashing the backs of my upper teeth and utterly destroying them! I went in search of a prosthodontist, which is a dentist with about three years more training than a normal dentist. I needed an expert who could build my teeth back up so that my front teeth would be saved. I could not find anyone in Canada or the US who could do the work in a reasonable time frame; and, their prices were far too high! On the internet I checked in Mexico and Costa Rica. I was leaning towards Costa Rica because I had previously lived there.\nI did contact three prosthodontists in Mexico but I found them to be rude and I did not trust them regarding materials. I corresponded with three prosthodontists in Costa Rica and decided to fly down to see one of them. It turned out that he had lied about something he had said in an email, so, I tried one of the other dentists instead. That did not work out either and the third guy was newly trained and he told me that he was not confident that he could restore my bite. I obtained a list of prosthodontists in Costa Rica and began to contact all of them by phone or email. Some"

I set the motor between the front and back left side wheels, the driver would sit to the right of the motor. I would build a coupling arrangement to attach the motor to the transaxle with chain.\nHarry brought wheels, tires, seat and steering box. After fashioning the base of the frame from 2 X 3 inch tubing (see photo), I built the roll cage, from 1 1/2 \" tubing . I then built a tubular front axle with spring over shock suspension, attaching it with tubular wishbones and a panhard bar. The rear end was mounted with VW transaxle minus the motor, using the VW torsion rear suspension. The trans was flipped over with the input shaft facing forward.\nNow on it's own wheels, I mounted the motor (see photo) and built an adapter to bolt to the rear of the crankshaft with a sprocket for double #50 chain.

I had to design some way to do that on the transaxle side of the connection. I took an old broken quick change rear end, cut off the back part that held the ratio gears. I modified it to fit on a plate mounted across the VW transaxle bellhousing. I welded a VW clutch hub to one side of the quickchange to fit over the input shaft of the transaxle, and a double row #50 chain sprocket to the other (see photo). A window was cut in the bellhousing to allow the chain to pass through. This car was very light,"

"islands many centuries before the migration of the Indians and the Chinese. We besides conclude political difference within the Malays ethnicities and the Indian ethnicities. This brings to attending the thought that even within the same race Malaysians were divided ; the Malays had the provincials and the royals, while the Indians were divided in to Ceylonese Tamils and Telugus.\nNow we will look at how race was viewed during colonial Malaya. Hirschman describes European attitudes towards the Malays as being paternalistic ( Hirschman 1986:42 ) , intending that the Europeans dealt with the Malays the manner a male parent would cover with his kids. The British besides viewed Malays as baronial provincials, whose life manner should be protected under colonial regulation ( Pennycook 1998:58 ) . Pennycook besides mentions that the position of Malays as being \u201c lazy \u201d started during the colonial regulation. The ground for this is that the Malays did non take part in the colonial economic system ( ibid 1998:58 ) . However the Malay nobility did profit from colonialism. These benefits that the grand Turks received are seen as a manner of keeping the fiction of Malay sovereignty ( Hirschman 1986:355 ) . Other grounds for Malay \u201c indolence \u201d are that Malays did non desire to work hard because their economic additions would acquire confiscated by the local elites, and nature was bountiful so they did non hold to work hard for the long term.\nDuring the colonial regulation the British derived their legitimacy from the Malay swayers, the British and the Malays had a particular relationship which both parties had a primary involvement in continuing. It \u2018s of import to bear in head that the confederation was between the British settlers and the royal nobility, and non between the British and the peasantry. Traditionally, Malayans were loyal to the Sultan. The Malay provincials were \u201c willing to obey ( Raja or head ) blindly. \u201d ( Swettenham in Birch 1924: 198 ) . The British \u2018s confederations with the Rajas reinforced the formal hierarchy of political power, with the Rulers. ( Snodgrass 1980:"
"Scotland as a society?\nSimilarly the unionist campaign has shown itself fraught, brittle and seemingly unable or unwilling to make the positive case for the union and how our society has been nourished in the past, and could be in the future by the union. Without this the union case seems to be the bastion of the last true romantic nationalists, defending a fantasyland UK which doesn\u2019t exist in reality.\nNow before I get brickbats from either camp, what the best of each side uses their argument for is as a proxy to believe it is a means to a better Scotland. But at the same time both are silent about that better Scotland.\nThat\u2019s the real Scotland we need to bring to the fore from the implicit to the explicit, and get past the fixation with process and talking about abstracts, combined with the self-interest of parts of institutional Scotland to keep things as they are.\nThe real debate would address some fundamentals. It would challenge the economic growth fetish mainstream politics is addicted to. It would talk about the difficult choices we need to make as a society about the environment, public services, demographics and more, and the balance between short-term populism and long-term gain. And it would bring to the fore the power of markets and global capital, and the collusion of most politicians with market fundamentalism. How can we create a society which isn\u2019t defined by professional institutional capture in public services, but also doesn\u2019t hand them over to corporate capture?\nThen there is the debate about the distributional consequences of the public decisions we make. More profoundly we have to question the innate assumption across most of society that we are on the right track to a better, fairer Scotland.\nAre we really? If so how can we be sure, and shouldn\u2019t we begin to exhibit a small bit of self-criticism rather than self-congratulation?\nSuch a debate would address who has authority, power and speaks in our name, and how a future Scotland, independent or not, might begin to shake this up and change things. And it would not put all its faith in politics or politicians, but have a wider idea of change.\nThis debate has to be about a different Scotland, about fleshing out what a better Scotland would look like, what its values are"

The dynamic technique allows arbitrary intensity profiles to be generated using a single unidirectional sweep of the collimators. The collimator jaws have independent motion, so that an aperture of variable width is scanned across the field. The algorithm has the form of a constrained optimization problem and jaw motions are optimized such that the treatment time for the field at a given dose rate is minimized. The application and results of this technique are presented, and it is shown that this approach provides an efficient practical implementation of conformal radiotherapy plans based on the use of intensity-modulated fields. The technique can be extended to 3D treatment plans and fields through the use of computer-controlled multileaf collimators.\nIntensity modulated radiation therapy treatment plan optimization\nIn this paper, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of optimization models for static radiation therapy treatment planning, focusing in particular on intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) by (i) establishing a novel connection between risk management and radiation therapy treatment planning, and (ii) unifying and contrasting two different modeling approaches. In addition, we discussion recent and ongoing technological developments which show that this area of research is a lively and promising one that can continue to help patients by improving the clinical practice of radiation therapy.\nRadiation Treatment Planning: Mixed Integer Programming Formulations and Approaches\nMichael C.

While, when silica fume is used the concrete compressive strength increase again to 29.2 MPa for samples with 100% of recycled aggregate.\nConcrete Waste Recycling Process for High Quality Aggregate\nIshikura, Takeshi; Fujii, Shin-ichi\nLarge amount of concrete waste generates during nuclear power plant (NPP) dismantling. Non-contaminated concrete waste is assumed to be disposed in a landfill site, but that will not be the solution especially in the future, because of decreasing tendency of the site availability and natural resources. Concerning concrete recycling, demand for roadbeds and backfill tends to be less than the amount of dismantled concrete generated in a single rural site, and conventional recycled aggregate is limited of its use to non-structural concrete, because of its inferior quality to ordinary natural aggregate. Therefore, it is vital to develop high quality recycled aggregate for general uses of dismantled concrete. If recycled aggregate is available for high structural concrete, the dismantling concrete is recyclable as aggregate for industry including nuclear field. Authors developed techniques on high quality aggregate reclamation for large amount of concrete generated during NPP decommissioning. Concrete of NPP buildings has good features for recycling aggregate; large quantity of high quality aggregate from same origin, record keeping of the aggregate origin, and little impurities in dismantled concrete such as wood and plastics. The target of recycled aggregate in this development is to meet the quality criteria for NPP concrete as prescribed in JASS 5N 'Specification for Nuclear Power Facility Reinforced Concrete' and JASS 5 'Specification for Reinforced Concrete Work'. The target of recycled aggregate concrete is to be comparable performance with ordinary aggregate concrete. The high quality recycled aggregate production techniques are assumed to apply for recycling for large amount of non-contaminated concrete. These techniques can also be applied for slightly contaminated concrete dismantled from radiological control area (RCA), together with free release survey. In conclusion: a technology on dismantled concrete recycling for high quality aggregate was developed\nResearch on Durability of Recycled Ceram"

"dispatched Mr. Wilson to Niger nor been briefed on what he found there.\nThis always sounded to me like an attempt on Rove's and Libby's part to explain away a very incriminating email, as Rove had with his email to Cooper and as Libby seems to have done with some of his notes. In other words, I suspect there's a document that shows Rove and Libby and Hadley were very actively talking about the issues appearing in Tenet's statement, whether or not Rove and Libby were actually involved in drafting the statement.\nBut the CIA disputes the Rove-Libby story in a WaPo article appearing a few days later.\nOn July 9, Tenet and top aides began to draft a statement over two days that ultimately said it was \"a mistake\" for the CIA to have permitted the 16 words about uranium to remain in Bush's speech. He said the information \"did not rise to the level of certainty which should be required for presidential speeches, and the CIA should have ensured that it was removed.\"\nA former senior CIA official said yesterday that Tenet's statement was drafted within the agency and was shown only to Hadley on July 10 to get White House input. Only a few minor changes were accepted before it was released on July 11, this former official said. He took issue with a New York Times report last week that said Rove and Vice President Cheney's chief of staff, I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, had a role in Tenet's statement.\nSo now we've got three different versions--at least--of the drafting of Tenet's mea culpa. Tenet says the CIA wrote it between July 9 and July 11; only Hadley reviewed it at the White House. Rove and Libby say they had been working on it longer than that. And Ari? Perhaps he agrees with both sides, when he says discussions have been going on for days but it all has been worked out previously.\nI don't know who is right. I actually suspect Rove and Libby might be (gasp!) telling a truth on this one.

"; Kevin Korchinski after being selected as the number seven / Eric Bolte-USA TODAY Sports\nThe signing of Kevin Korchinski begins the next era of Chicago Blackhawks hockey, and the potential legacy of Kyle Davidson.\nKevin Korchinski, the Chicago Blackhawks' seventh overall selection in the 2022 draft will enter the NHL in a couple of years, but the expectations that will follow him for his entire career will be daunting. Kyle Davidson believes that Korchinski would be more valuable than Alex Debrincat in the long term... And this, as it has been speculated already, will Davidson's first major gamble of his career and the one that will forever determine his success as general manager.\nSure, there is a lot to like about Korchinski. He skates amazingly, is an offensive dynamo on defense, takes hits like a champ, has height, and projects to be a top-two defenseman. However, that is not what he will be expected to be for the Blackhawks fan base... Most likely. When you trade a superstar in what is honestly a one-for-one deal for a prospect, the prospect will be expected to offer as much if not more for the team. Korchinski will be expected to be a number 1 defenseman for the Blackhawks who can dominate on both ends of the ice.\nKyle Davidson has decided to build a team that follows his vision: Fast, high work ethic, and responsible on both ends of the ice. He has allowed Dylan Strome and Dominik Kubalik to walk because they don't fit the new identity. With that said... Alex Debrincat did fit the mold here but we know that he was, after Patrick Kane, the Blackhawks' most valuable piece. Everyone expected more in a return for Debrincat... But all the Blackhawks really got was Kevin Korchinski.\nI will be rooting for the kid like every Blackhawks fan, but I will also have high expectations and expect Korchinski to develop into a Cale Makar type defenseman with comparable impact. If he doesn't become a top-defenseman in the league like Alex Debrincat is a top-scorer in the league"

Various state anti-discrimination laws have ruined Christian wedding businesses with large fines and legal fees, and also led to many others receiving abuse from LGBT activists.\nThe issue is now before the US Supreme Court in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, a saga which began in 2012 when Masterpiece Cakeshop refused to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex wedding. They were then sued under Colorado state law which bars discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in public accommodations. The Court is considering if the law violates the free exercise of religion under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\nBut businesses being forced to serve people whose beliefs/lifestyles they disagree with would appear to only go one way. Since the election of Trump, his supporters have found themselves the target of abuse and discrimination. Trump supporters are easily recognisable in public, proudly wearing the iconic Make America Great Again caps.\nThe wearing of this cap got one Trump supporter Greg Piatek, 31 kicked out of New York City bar The Happiest Hour after Trump\u2019s inauguration.

You inevitably wind up cramming for the test, listening to lots of neglected music while operating under the worst possible mindset. (\"Do I like this better than I like my 10th-favorite album of the year? No? NEXT.\") And, of course, you're guaranteed to get flayed alive in the comments section, given that there's no one on earth whose opinions align evenly with your own.\nBut you know what? That's just a bunch of glass-half-empty bellyaching. Getting to discover music for a living is a gift, and filing an article at the end of the year about the stuff you loved isn't exactly stirring a vat of boiling tar, as unpleasant tasks go. As for these picks for 2011's 10 best albums \u2014 bearing in mind that \"best albums\" is, as in past years, code for \"favorite albums, if you're this one guy\" \u2014 feel free to have at it in the comments.

Both KIinkert and Rueping had worked many years inthe brewing business before setting up this brewery in West Superior, Wisconsin\nJohn KIinkert was born in Hesse-Darmstadt,Germany in 1849 and came to America in 1865. His experience as a brewer datesback to his graduation from the Brewers Academy at Frankfort, Germany. From 1867to 1882, he was employed in some of the principal breweries of Milwaukee,including six years as foreman of the Philip Best Brewery. In 1882, he bought aone-half interest in the Red River Brewery at Fargo, North Dakota, with John G.Kraenzlein. Two years later, Kraenzlein sold his interest to Louis Rueping. KIinkertand Rueping were successful with their small operation in North Dakota untilearly Prohibition laws closed down their brewery in 1889. The pair moved to WestSuperior, Wisconsin, in 1890, and continued their partnership by building a newbrewery, the KIinkert Brewing Company. It was one of seven breweries operatingin Superior to quench the iron ore miners\u2019 thirst for good beer.\nJohn KIinkert dissolved the partnership in 1898, selling hisinterest so he could start a brewery with Frank Pabst.

Spectator, No. 169.\nIf we make a pause at misery, and none at mankind, we find an improper classification of the words; which is immediately removed either by pausing at mankind and not pausing at misery; or by pausing at them both, or by pausing at neither.\nAnother instance will show us more clearly how punctuation depends upon classification, or such an\nassociation of parts as shows the union and distinction of such as are similar and such as are different.\nWhen the proud steed shall know why man restrains\nHis fiery course, or drives him o'er the plains;\nWhen the dull ox, why now he breaks the clod,\nWhy now a victim, and now Egypt's god:\nThen shall man's pride and dulness comprehend\nHis actions', passions', being's use and end.\nPope's Essay on Man.\nIn the last couplet of this passage, if we pause at comprehend without pausing at dulness, we shall not suf ficiently distinguish the subject and the verb; if we place a pause at dulness and not at comprehend, we shall not distinguish the verb from that class of words which forms its object; but, if we pause both at dulness and at comprehend, we shall mark both these distinctions, and class all the words together, according to their respective similarities and differences.\nPausing, therefore does not seem to depend so much on placing a pause in any particular part of a sentence, as in that part which most requires it. Thus we may very properly place a pause in the middle of a complex nominative case; but if, after this, we join the whole nominative to the verb, without a pause, we shall soon perceive an improper classification of words: which proves that pausing is relative, and that a pause is proper or improper, not absolutely and considered by itself, but relatively and as it stands connected with other pauses which can"

It showcased some of the most important avant-garde and post-dramatic works from the sixties through the eighties \u2013 like performances of Richard Schechner, Jerzy Grotowski and Peter Brook \u2013 as well as traditional Asian art forms such as Beijing Opera and Kathakali Dance Theatre. During the Cold War, it was one of the few global hubs where artists from the East and the West could meet safely. During international sanctions of the 1990s caused by war and the break-up of Yugoslavia, BITEF continued presenting international performances, but put a special accent on regional ones. As the new century approached, it found a special place for technologically innovative works, but it took a devastating pandemic and a global wave of lockdowns for the festival to showcase the first performance that takes place entirely online \u2013 The Cherry Orchard in the Cherry Orchard.\nThe Cherry Orchard in the Cherry Orchard is a production of de facto theatre company from Zagreb, a company that liberally works across disciplines of theatre, dance and performance.

This year, Rake, Front wings and clever suspensions will be the emerging trends. Sidepods will also be a big differentiator, as teams move the sidepod around to gain the best airflow to the rear of the car.

"but we should neither be frightened of it nor shrink from addressing it. We need to change both the mindset and the toolkit for managing global forces in coastal areas. We need to keep an open mind and embrace that change in the best interests of all peoples and for future generations and, most importantly we must use every tool at our disposal for sound, effective, rational and unencumbered coastal management, rooted in a socially just framework.\nAny debate and subsequent framework must acknowledge the rights of, and engage with Coastal communities. Ultimately it is the political will that will promote a pro- poor approach. As stated By Kofi Annan (UNESCO):\n\u201cWe already have the technical skills to halt destructive trends and to place our economies on a more sustainable footing. It is not knowledge and scientific research, but political and economic factors that will determine whether or not the wisdom accumulating in our laboratories and libraries will be put into practice. Challenges such as climate change and population growth are testing not only our imagination, but also our will.\u201d Kofi Annan\nGovernments should fully respect the unique role and range of activities undertaken by coastal communities and landowners and protect them in the face of international economic pressure. The symbiotic relationship of these communities and the marine environment means that there are clear economic justifications for their continued involvement to achieve a balance in both sustainable environmental outcomes and social justice.\nFinally to address the questions posed at the outset, communities:\n\u2013 Do have a right of access now and for future generations\n\u2013 With support can be viable and regain a social standing\n\u2013 Genuinely could engage, given the Mont Fleur exempla, and\n\u2013 Require the facilitating role of Government and Professionals to encourage the process.\nAs an inclusive democratic and pro poor approach to growth, this will be the flight of the Flamingo\u2019s, as Flamingos characteristically take off slowly, fly high, and fly together (Kahane).\nDitton B, Seymore, J.L, Swanson, GC: Coastal Resources Management; Beyond Bureaucracy and the Market, Lexington.\nDumashie, D.

"of the liver differs depending on the temperature, construction of a system that satisfies the oxygen demand of the liver is crucial for optimizing the preservation temperature. In this study, a MP system, which satisfies the oxygen demand of liver at each temperature, was constructed using an index of oxygen supply; the overall volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient, the amount of oxygen retention of perfusate and oxygen saturation. Both subnormothermic MP (SNMP, 20-25 \u00b0C) and normothermic MP (NMP, 37 \u00b0C) could maintain liver viability at a high level (94%). However, lactate metabolism of the liver during NMP was more active than that during SNMP. Furthermore, the ammonia metabolism of liver after NMP was superior to that after SNMP. Hence, NMP, which maintains the metabolic activity of the liver, is more suitable for preservation of the donor liver than SNMP, which suppresses the metabolic activity. In summary, normothermia is the optimal temperature for liver preservation, and we succeeded in constructing an NMP system that could suppress liver damage and maintain function..\n4.

"the programmes. M&E strategies differed in the settings due to the differences in vector ecology, scale of the programmes and programme design. The impact of the intervention on the disease can be assessed through government health records in conjunction with the monitoring of other disease control efforts and was not costed as part of the LSM programme.\nFollowing development of the spreadsheet model for each intervention setting, cost implications of two scenarios using the alternative formulations of VectoBac\u00ae were evaluated for Vihiga District (weekly application for four months) and Mbita Division (weekly application all year round).\nScenario 1 - use of WG formulation for liquid application;\nScenario 2 - use of CG formulation for hand application.\nThe type of formulation used affects product storage, associated equipment and shipping costs. The implications of changes in the larvicide product price in both of these scenarios were also examined. In Dar es Salaam larvicide product use was based on actual usage of a combination of WG and CG products, therefore a scenario analysis was not carried out however we did look at the implications of changes in larvicide product prices.\nModel programme structure, staffing and training\nThe proposed programme structure for a LSM programme covering 15 city wards (5 per municipality) is shown in Figure 1. Table 2 lists the staff required and their responsibility in the programme. The programme is overseen by a programme manager who is directly responsible to the City Medical Officer and the NMCP. The manager is assisted in the daily work by two surveillance officers. Each of the three municipalities in Dar es Salaam has a malaria control coordinator that will ensure quality work implemented on ward level. Two inspectors per municipality will implement quality control and help with training activities. Each ward will have a supervisor overseeing the work of community-based resource persons (CORPs) involved in larval surveillance and larviciding. Two larval surveillance CORPs per ward will be responsible for habitat spot checks to ensure that larval habitats are treated in a timely manner and the larvicide is working. The number of LCPs was calculated based on the area one person can cover per week (0.2-1.5 km2) [34]. Technical assistance from"
"-person variability was identical and only between-person variability varied between conditions. In the first condition, the simulated data have identical between-person and within-person variance. As a result, we obtain a low ICC and conclude that the measurement instrument fails to adequately discriminate among persons. However, critically, we also obtain a rather low CV, implying high precision to detect deviation from zero (see left panel of Figure 2). In the second instance, between-person standard deviation was larger than within-person standard deviation by a factor of five. This condition yields a high ICC reflecting the fact that the measure discriminates well among persons. At the same time, CV remains low, which implies reasonable precision of detecting differences from zero. This is because the within-person variance is still relatively low in comparison to the means (see right panel of Figure 2).\nEach plot shows simulated data of 10 repeated measurements of a fictitious outcome X for five persons.\nWithin-person variance is identical over persons and panels. Left panel: Between-person variance is identical to within-person variance. In that case, ICC-indexed reliability is estimated at a rather low ICC = 0.48, whereas CV-indexed precision is fair, with averaged CV = 0.07. Right panel: Between-person standard deviation is larger than within-person standard deviation by a factor of five. In this condition, estimated ICC-indexed reliability is high (ICC = 0.96), but CV-indexed precision remains identical with averaged CV = 0.07 as the within-person standard deviation is still fairly small with respect to the sample mean.\nIn summary, whereas the CV refers to the precision of measurement obtained from each object, the ICC expresses a part-whole relation of variance observed in the data. All other things being equal, a less precise measurement will increase the variance-within, and hence compromise our ability to detect between-person differences. On the other hand, a rather imprecise measurement (as indexed by the CV obtained for each object of measurement) may nevertheless yield high reliability (as indexed by the ICC) if the between-person differences in means are large.\nIntra-class effect decomposition (ICED)\nThe extant neuroimaging literature typically offers little justification for the choice"

"189 (January 12, 2013), Opportunity was busily gathering data on the veins in this area where varying concentrations appear, taking the requisite series of pictures with her MI for a mosaic and APXS integrations to determine the chemical composition. Just as the rover had done at Vermilion on Copper Cliff, it began a series of measurements on Whitewater Lake's Ortiz area, in sections just off-set from one another.\nThat same sol, the MER team implemented the detection diagnostic command for the rover's Flash file system to flag the occurrence of any future amnesia events. \"This is like the character with amnesia in a Hollywood movie writing notes to himself,\" said Callas.\nFrom here on out, when the engineers see a flag in EEPROM they will know what to do to retrieve the data. \"The late-night wake-ups to turn off the APXS are the only ones we've seen the amnesia events on to date,\" Nelson said, \"and we have a way of working around it for the time being.\" Essentially, the workaround involves downloading the data from the APXS instrument, which also stores the data it collects, before that instrument is used again. \"That will protect our APXS data, which is about the only thing that we're doing on these late-night wake-ups,\" he said.\nOpportunity has been fine since though. No amnesia events have occurred since Sol 3183 (January 6, 2013), \"and the rover remains in good health,\" assured Callas.\nOpportunity continued her in-depth examination of the tiny white veins on Whitewater Lake throughout the middle of January, collecting the pictures for MI mosaics and APXS data on sections labeled Ortiz2, Ortiz3, and Ortiz2-b.\n\"We made a number of measurements in four places on this place on Whitewater Lake we call Ortiz, places of high concentrations of veins and low concentrations of veins with the APXS, all of it supported with MI images to show what the concentration of veins was, so we knew what we were looking at with the APXS,\" Squyres explained.\nKirk"
"could be alarming or make people feel more protective or more fragile over time, too.\nYeah. And that's a really good point I would like to clarify, in saying that, that my encouragement would be to them, is that at different stages, different things are going to be appropriate. When it's in the really bad flared up stage, that's where I'm going to tell them \"Don't do that.\" But as they begin to get a little bit more movement, I'm going to do exactly what you said, just tell them to push the envelope a little bit, but we don't want to do it when it's really in that flared up stage because that will, a lot of times, increase the neural sensitivity.\nWell, basic inflammation approaches, meaning if it's inflamed, we treat it carefully. And this isn't the place, and, like you said, to stimulate or increase, willy-nilly at least, the inflammation. We want to calm it. We want to increase the adaptive range around it. And some of that's through just rest and avoiding irritants, movements that irritate, and some of that can be re-contextualizing or perfusion or hydration, different things like that\nYeah. And one of the other I want to talk about for just a second, draw back to our discussion of using these procedures from an evaluation standpoint. I also find these really valuable as a marker of progress for people. So, when you set a baseline at the outset, like they only get their leg up to about 45 degrees or less of hip flexion until that really just lights up and then six weeks down the line we're working, let's take a look at this again and see where we are, and all of a sudden they realize, oh wow, I can get farther than I did before. That's a nice, objective measure of improvement that really stimulates positive thought and positive momentum about making progress in there.\nWell, it gives another marker besides just, \"It hurts,\" too. Because \"It hurts\" is hard to track over time. I mean, I do everything I can to avoid that being my only measure of success because, as amazing as we can be about helping people with pain, if that's our"

How important is the vision of the company to you?\nIt should be very important if you want a long standing career. Remember, you're investing your time, energy and earnings potential into a company so you want to make sure it's a sustainably successful company that will grow with you over the long haul.\n36. What do you already know about our company?\nGood reputation of a large home grown company that has various departments and product.\n37. Explain me about a challenge or conflict you've faced at work At Wells Dairy, and how you dealt with it?\nIn asking this interview question, your interviewer wants to get a sense of how you will respond to conflict. Anyone can seem nice and pleasant in a job interview, but what will happen if you're hired?. Again, you'll want to use the S-T-A-R method, being sure to focus on how you handled the situation professionally and productively, and ideally closing with a happy ending, like how you came to a resolution or compromise.\n38. What role do you see technology playing in this role?\nTechnology is important to almost every job today but it's not meant to be abused. I believe it's important to increase productivity and not for personal use.\n39. What is your greatest strength? How does it help you At Wells Dairy?\nOne of my greatest strengths, and that I am a diligent worker... I care about the work getting done.. I am always willing to help others in the team..

A beautiful story, beautifully written.\nCategory: Book chat, Children's Books, Poetry | LEAVE A COMMENT\nA Wizard of Earthsea, by Ursula Le Guin\nThe Earthsea Quartet, by Ursula Le Guin\nTitle: A Wizard of Earthsea\nAuthor: Ursula Le Guin\nGenre/ issues: Fantasy\n\u201cBut need alone is not enough to set power free: there must be knowledge.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know why I\u2019d not read any Ursula Le Guin before now, and delving into A Wizard of Earthsea this week has been a pure delight. We follow the life of Sparrowhawk, whose true name in the Old Language is Ged, and in the magic world of Earthsea true names have power. By knowing the true name of a creature or a thing you can enchant it, or control it.\nAs we follow Ged from childhood through troublesome adolescence, to his apprenticeship with the Wizard Ogion and his tutelage at the School of Wizards on Roke, he finds himself on a quest to defeat the shadow that has plagued him since an I\u2019ll-advised magical pissing contest with a fellow student unleashed it into the world. And the shadow knows Ged\u2019s name.\nThis book is wonderful. A short read at just 161 pages in length, it has deceptively simple linear narrative, and magnificent world building that sucks you in to Earthsea, with its archipelago of islands, complex and highly functioning trade routes, and deep respect for magic and the role of wizards. Whilst we see many villages as we travel with Ged, the inhabitants are largely left to do their own thing in the background, and our protagonist is one of only 3 characters that are given the space to grow in this right and deftly written masterpiece.\nAnd, speaking of the writing \u2026 woah. Much of the action takes place on a boat, as you would expect from a land of tiny islands amidst an expansive ocean. This felt appropriate, as there\u2019s a flow and a lilt to Le Guin\u2019"

It turns out that a 1906 renovation of the state's law code had repealed all previous laws without reestablishing the flag's official status.\nThe flag was reestablished in law in February 2001, and soon afterwards confirmed by voters, who rejected a flag change in a statewide referendum. But from 1906 to 2001, the state had been technically without an official flag.\nSymbols of the Confederacy\nFirst national flag of the Confederate States of America (1861-1863)\nThe emblem removed by the Mississippi state government is seen as a symbol of heritage or righteous defiance by its supporters, and as a symbol of racism by its opponents. It's commonly called the \"Confederate flag\", but it wasn't actually the national flag of the Confederate states.\nOn the other hand, it did get included in the corner of the Confederate national flag two years into the war, after being used as a military banner in battle. Its position on that second flag was almost the same as on the now-defunct Mississippi state flag.\nSecond national flag of the Confederate States of America (1863-1865)\nWhile Mississippi was the last remaining state to feature the actual Confederate battle emblem on its flag (Georgia removed its own in 2001), Confederate symbolism in state flags still lives on.

We understand now the \"hows\" of everything Alexander Luthor has been planning, if not necessarily the \"whys.\" I'm glad to see all of the Countdown miniseries tied together, even Day of Vengeance, and the suggestion that the heroes will become more pro-active now, lead by Batman, portends good things for the rest of the series.\nUnfortunately, this issue felt very compressed to me, and with only three issues left to go, I'm afraid that the next three issues will feel compressed, too. There was a lot of great stuff here, almost on every page--dropping Chemo on Bludhaven, Crispus Allen becoming the Spectre, learning how all four Countdown miniseries finally tie in, a big shocking fight scene, and the return of Barry Allen and Max Mercury--but it all just seemed to come so quickly that it felt like some things got short-changed. For instance, apparently the beetle scarab is now attached to the new Blue Beetle's spine; maybe it would have been a waste of pages to show that actually happening, but when Booster Gold talked about it, I felt like I had missed something. In the case of something like Infinite Crisis, I don't mind being taken step-by-step, and if that meant that Infinite Crisis would have been twelve issues like the original, that would have been fine with me.\nI was however glad to see that it doesn't look like Wally West died, or, at least, I don't think he did."
"and Stanvac, which was owned by Mobil. In 1970, after leaving the army, Lolo Soetoro went to work for Mobil, which was assured of no interference from the pro-U.S. Suharto government.\nIn April 1965, Sukarno expelled the Peace Corps from Indonesia as he grew more and more suspicious of American covert activities in his country. The next month, Sukarno accused the United States and Britain of planning a coup against him with the aid of the Indonesian army. Army forces began to call back Indonesian army reserve officers who were studying abroad in order to supplement their ranks for the planned coup against Sukarno. On July 20, 1965, Lolo Soetoro, who had been in the United States receiving CIA- and Pentagon-funded training since September 18, 1962, left Hawaii for Indonesia. He had married Ann Dunham on March 15, 1965. Ann Soetoro received her U.S. passport on July 19, 1965, the day before Lolo Soetoro left for Indonesia and just as events were heating up in Indonesia.\nSuspiciously, Lolo Soetoro's Wikipedia entry has been altered to reflect his departure from Hawaii to Indonesia in 1966, the year following the coup. It appears that certain interests want to cover up Lolo Soetoro's involvement in the 1965 CIA coup.\nIn August, Sukarno committed the arch sin as viewed by the West and quasi-CIA support organizations like the Ford Foundation. Sukarno withdrew Indonesia from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and INTERPOL. In August, while receiving a foreign delegation, Sukarno began to vomit uncontrollably and he collapsed.

An increase of a further 25% is made for each additional sub-family. 10 biocidal products may be included in each sub-family. For each additional biocidal product in a sub-family, the fee increases by one per cent. No additional charge is made for biocidal products in a biocidal product family or sub-family that do not differ (i.e. whether in their use, method of use etc.) other than by their concentration of pigments, colorants or fragrances.\nIn case of withdrawal of the application during the procedure, following fees will be charged:\nBefore validation (art. 16 para. 2 OPB): no fees\nAfter validation: 25% of the charged fees\nAfter the evaluation (art. 17 para. 2 OPB) has started: 50-75% of the charged fees"

We work together to prepare the concert all week and it is truly a MEMF community project. The music will be drawn from settings and compositions based on Lutheran chorales such as Ein Feste Burg and from the Choir Library of the Marienkirche.\nThe concert concludes with Buxtehude\u2019s Missa Brevis and concludes with his grand motet, Benedicam Dominum in omne tempore, written for six contrasting choirs, which Buxtehude surely composed to match the structural design of the Marienkirche. (You can hear the Kyrie from Buxtehude\u2019s \u201cMissa Brevis\u201d in the YouTube video at the bottom.)\nAre there other sessions \u2014 guest lectures, certain performers, particular works \u2014 that you especially recommend for the general public?\nAll the planning that goes into each festival leads me to encourage the general public to attend everything.

This subset of adjunct faculty is fulfilling a critical role in the higher education landscape, yet the variability of these appointments makes it exceedingly difficult to assess their needs and, ultimately, provide adequate support.\nIn 2017, COACHE partners at the University at Buffalo set out to address this knowledge gap by adapting the Faculty Job Satisfaction Survey to suit the needs of their part-time faculty. In this webinar, Robert Granfield and Tilman Baumstark will share the challenges faced and lessons learned, both from their methodology and from their faculty, throughout this endeavor."

"uses a metaphor to motivate John Quincy Adams to actively engage in the voyage as well. By incorporating a comparison of a \u201cjudicious traveller to a river\u201d (lines 16-17) into her letter, Abigail Adams conveys that as John Quincy Adam travels, he will strengthen as an individual, similarly to how a stream will strengthen its flows as it travels at a greater distance. This builds logic because the purpose of going on the voyage is to allow him to gain more experience and knowledge. By defining the benefits he will receive, Abigail Adams hopes that it will incline John Quincy Adams to earnestly participate in the voyage and prosper.\nAbigail Adam also uses allusion to strengthen her overall argument. The author alludes to Julius Caesar by asking, \u201cWould Cicero have shone so distinguished as an orator if he had not been roused, kindled, and inflamed by the tyranny Catiline, Verres, and Mark Antony?\u201d (line 30-32). She explains that Cicero succeeded as an orator despite the challenges he had encountered. Likewise, John Quincy Adams must overcome difficulties and overlook his unwillingness in order to achieve greatness. Abigail Adams hope that he understands that hard work will lead to progress and prosperity.\nAbigail Adam uses a thoughtful tone, a metaphor, and an allusion to strengthen her persuasion in hopes that John Quincy Adams will take her words of encouragement into consideration in order to strive and succeed as an individual. The sincerity enables Abigail Adams to express herself from a maternal point of view, while the metaphor and allusion build logics as they are examples that John Quincy Adams is familiar with. Abigail Adams uses this combination of rhetorical devices in hopes that her son will wholly partake in the voyage.\nAbigail Adams Letter To John Quincy Adams. (2021, May 01).

Bank of America NA, case number 0:13-cv-61372, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florid, alleges BoFA uses automated dialers to call the cell phones of people who have debt with the bank. That would certainly raise your blood pressure.\nSpecifically, Katz claims that in 2010 BoFA launched a mortgage foreclosure action against him in Florida state court. The bank then continued to call his cellphone using automated dialing systems in an effort to try and collect the purported debt. This occurred even after the bank was told to contact Katz\u2019s attorney for anything related to the foreclosure action, according to the lawsuit.\n\u201cDespite receipt of a letter of representation, and its inherent cease communication directive, defendant\u2019s continued collection efforts involved the placement of auto-dialed calls and/or recorded messages to the cellular telephones of allegedly delinquent consumers,\u201d the debt collection harassment class action lawsuit states.\n"

All the details including demographic, obstetric history, medical history, labor details, and details of CS including indication were entered in the prescribed format which was approved by department research committee. All the deliveries were classified as per RTGCS into ten groups with the help of Robson implementation manual by the WHO using the flow chart [Figure 1]. The variables which are necessary for classification include parity, gestational age, presentation, previous CS, onset of labor, and number of fetuses. Robson manual tool kit was used as a guide. A senior obstetrician periodically verified the entered data including its completeness. The deliveries that happened before 24 weeks of gestation or baby weight of < 500 g were excluded. If the gestational age was not known for an unbooked woman who was referred in later part of pregnancy the fetal weight was used as proxy for classifying; birth weight of 2500 g or more was considered as term gestation (37 weeks or more). The groups 2, 4 and 5 of RTGCS were sub-classified into a or b as per the flow chart [Figure 1].\nFigure 1: Flow chart used for classification based on Robson-1o group classification system.

Saran emphasizes the impossibility of the privatization of religion in the Hindu tradition as it has been implied by secular and outside social influences. In addition to modernism and Islam, Saran also discusses the implications of British colonial rule and Christianity as these also limited the sustainability of the Hindu tradition.

He plays in one of the friendliest hitting environments in the Pacific Coast League, calling Southwest University Park in lovely El Paso home, and despite playing 39 games in other bandboxes throughout the PCL, he\u2019s mustered just a .252/.272/.479 line that includes eight home runs (and 39 punchouts against just five walks) in 163 at-bats anywhere other than El Paso this season. He certainly is capable of providing some pop in San Diego if he is called upon after the trade deadline, but I just don\u2019t see him helping with much else. I don\u2019t view Renfroe as much different than the player that hit 19 home runs in 172 Double-A games in 2014 and 2015, other than a (very) slightly improved strikeout rate since reaching El Paso, and I see a walk rate that\u2019s almost half what it was in the Texas League and a overall slash line that\u2019s been propped up by a bandbox for a home park and the addition of about 40 points of BABIP since his time in San Antonio.\n23) Mike Clevinger, RHP, Cleveland Indians (Last week: 23)\n24) Josh Bell, 1B, Pittsburgh Pirates (Last week: 24)\n25) Mike Minor, LHP, Kansas City Royals (Last week: 25)\nMinor, who hasn"

"Reality TV\nby Saeyanni Simmons<s> Does the Toyota bZ4X Have Apple CarPlay?\nToyota was among the first automakers to introduce environmentally friendly cars with the Prius. And though the company has been slow to electrify its lineup, the first fully electric production model has finally arrived. Here\u2019s a look at the all-new 2023 Toyota bZ4X, including tech features such as Apple CarPlay.\nToyota\u2019s new EV with a quirky name\nUnfortunate name notwithstanding, there are a lot of things to like about the 2023 @Toyota bZ4X, chief among them its regular-car vibes.\nCheck out our pros and cons below. https://t.co/TMY5jCUIJn\n\u2014 Cars.com (@carsdotcom) June 28, 2022\nToyota shared its intention to produce cars with zero emissions with the bZ4X lineup. The \u201cbZ\u201d in the name stands for \u201cbeyond zero\u201d and nods to the company\u2019s environmental pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.\nThe bZ4X has a traditional family-SUV-like exterior design and shares elements with the best-selling RAV4.\nAs for powertrains, the bZ4X\u2019s base model has standard front-wheel-drive and an electric motor producing 201 hp and 196 lb-ft of torque. There\u2019s also a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive version making only slightly more horsepower, at 214 hp and 248 lb-ft, according to Toyota.\nThe dual-motor AWD model accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 6.4 seconds in Car and Driver testing and 5.8 seconds in MotorTrend testing. Although the bZ4X\u2019s acceleration time doesn\u2019t come close to the Tesla Model Y\u2019s 3.5 seconds, it\u2019s not far off from the Volkswagen ID.4\u2019s 7.6-second split.\nIn addition, the bZ4X has a 64.0-kWh battery pack.

"VFR flight in Class D with less than three miles visibility, but greater than one mile, would require a Special VFR clearance.\nThe airport symbol is blue, which signifies that the airport has an operating control tower at least part of the time.From the Chart: Look at figure 1 of Owensboro, Kentucky.\nThe control tower frequency of 120.7 has a star beside it, which indicates that this control tower does not operate 24 hours a day. Pilots must check the Airport/Facilities Directory for the exact open and closed times.\nThe airport is also ringed with a blue dashed line. The blue dashes tell you that Class D Airspace will be in effect anytime the control tower is open.\nInside the blue dashed line there are bracketed digits, \u2018[29].\u2019 The \u201c[29]\u201d is a code that tells how high up the Class D Airspace goes: in this case, 2,900 feet MSL (approximately 2,500 feet AGL). So the Class D airspace is cylinder shape and begins at the ground and ends at 2,900 MSL.\nCLASS D OPERATIONS/COMMUNICATIONS\nThe control tower operator at a Class D airport cannot see you coming on radar (remember, they don\u2019t have radar). Therefore, you must communicate with the control tower operator to take off, to land, or to fly through the Class D cylinder. You would only be required to communicate with the tower prior to entering the blue dashed circle. You might say, \u201cOwensboro Tower, Cessna 1234A, eight south, inbound for landing.\u201d The tower controller might respond with, \u201cCessna 1234A, visibility is 6 miles, enter and report left downwind for runway 18.\u201d\nTranslation: The controller cannot see you, so he clears you into the blue dashed circle, and asks you to report at another location where he probably will be able to see you: left downwind. When you enter and report the downwind, chances are good the controller has you in the binoculars and when you say, \u201cOwensboro Tower 34A left downwind to runway 18,\u201d the controller will say,"

"himself as an Enemy to the whole Body of the People.XI. Fourthly, The same Barclay observes, that if a King shall, like an Enemy,1 design the utter Destruction of the whole Body of his People, he loses his Kingdom; which I grant. For the Design of Governing, and the Design of destroy-[121]ing are inconsistent together. Wherefore he that declares himself an Enemy to the whole Nation, is presumed by that very Act to renounce the Government. But such an Excess of Fury2 can hardly, in my Opinion, enter the Thoughts of a King, that is in his right Senses, and that governs only one Nation. But if he govern several, it may so happen, that in Favour to one, he should endeavour3 to destroy another, in order to people the Lands of the former with Colonies sent from the latter.\nXII. And against a King, who breaks the Condition, upon which he was admitted.XII. Fifthly, If a Kingdom be forfeited, either1 for Felony against him of whom it is a Fief, or by vertue2 of a Clause in the Act whereby the Sovereignty had been conferred, and which declares that if the King does such or such a Thing, his Subjects shall from that Time be absolved from all Allegiance to him, then also a King becomes a private Person.\nXIII. And against a King, who having but one Part of the Sovereign Power invades the other.XIII. Sixthly, If a King should have but one Part of the sovereign Power, and the Senate or People1 the other, if such a King shall invade that Part which is not his own, he may justly be resisted, because he is not Sovereign in that Respect. Which I believe may take Place, though in the Division2 of the Sovereignty, the Power of making War fell to the King, for that is to be understood of a foreign War: Since whoever has a Share of the Sovereignty must have at the same Time a Right to defend it. And when the Case is so, the King may, by the Right of War, lose even his Part of the Sover"

Corporates have played a huge role in backing these enterprises.\nSalesforce Ventures leads the list of corporate unicorn hunters, followed by GV (formerly Google Ventures), Comcast Ventures, Intel Capital, and In-Q-Tel, a private firm that invests on behalf of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). To look at the numbers is to see a lot of deep-pocketed hopefuls with dreams of joining this elite list.

"when not occasionally seasoned, it leads to more food sticking to the surface.\nHot handles\nCast iron pans retain heat incredibly well. This can act as both a blessing and a curse, as the metal handles of these pans are incredibly hot when used in an oven or broiler. With this in mind, it\u2019s essential to be mindful of a cast iron\u2019s handles and use oven mitts or something similar when holding it.\nBest cast iron pans\nSome top choices for cast iron skillets include the Victoria Cast Iron Frying Pan and the Lodge Seasoned Cast Iron 3 Skillet Bundle. The Victoria skillet has two side handles for easy handling and a spout to help with excess grease. The Lodge Cast Iron Skillet Bundle is an excellent choice for those looking for a cast iron set. The 8-, 10.5- and 12-inch skillets ensure maximum versatility for all types of dishes.\nStainless steel pans\nStainless steel is one of the most popular materials for cookware today. It\u2019s made through cladding, in which layers of metal (typically aluminum or copper) are bonded together to help heat evenly conduct throughout the cookware.\nLike cast iron pans, stainless steel pans are incredibly durable. Additionally, the pans contain chromium, which creates a passive layer of oxide on its exterior surface, ensuring protection against things like scratching or corrosion.\nWhat you\u2019ll love about stainless steel pans\nStainless steel pans are extremely versatile. They can be used to cook just about everything from breakfast options like eggs and bacon to dinners like meats and sauteed vegetables. Stainless steel pans are considered non-reactive, unlike cast iron pans, which means acidic foods like sauces and wine will not damage the exterior. Additionally, they can be used in any situation, from stovetop to oven use.\nUnlike cast iron pans, stainless steel pans don\u2019t need to be seasoned to be cleaned. They can be easily cleaned with soap and water and are usually dishwasher-safe.\nQuick heating\nSince they have a layered metal construction, stainless steel pans heat quickly."

"igh of relief this week when Dr. Anthony Fauci announced that benevolent burglar and emotional blackmailer Santa Claus had received the vaccine for coronavirus and would be able to drop into homes without creating a crisis. This is very good news for the good kids of the world and also the kids who have managed Ferris Bueller their ways into seeming good, and the segment on it was very adorable. But, unfortunately I have some concerns.\nFirst of all, Dr. Fauci said that he got on a plane and went to the North Pole to give Santa Claus the vaccine himself. This statement alone should trigger a Senate investigation. Did Fauci fly commercial? Isn\u2019t he encouraging people to not do that? WHAT IS THE TRUTH? If he flew private, who paid for it? The American taxpayers, that\u2019s who. And, more importantly, who got the frequent flyer points? We need trans-fare-rency.\nThis is the real crime being committed by Pole workers! Why wasn\u2019t there any footage of this meeting? Why was press locked out of an important geopolitical moment? Is Santa Claus even real?!\nIn a week when we saw absolute ghouls like Lindsay Graham and Mike Pence receive the vaccine despite doing everything in their power to minimize or outright deny the danger posed by the pandemic, inoculating Santa Claus isn\u2019t the worst problem we face but, folks, this is a slippery slope.\nHow did Santa Claus jump to the head of the queue? Are we saying that he\u2019s an essential worker? Did the Krampus also receive a vaccine? Why did Santa have curbside delivery on the vaccine like he ordered it on InstaCart\u2019s new side business, InstaCure? Why didn\u2019t Santa have to go down to the Walgreen\u2019s or wherever like everyone else to get his shot?\nSpeaking of going down to the Walgreen\u2019s or wherever, I love the absolutely empty energy of this video of Mike Pence and Karen Pence receiving the first shot of the Pfizer vaccine.

This could also be a reason for not running AArch64(?). Perhaps the chips aren't fully functional in that regard. Rather than letting the chips go to waste, might as well sell them in a few select markets, right?\nAlso, they've been making and tuning the A15/A7 memory controllers for quite some time and across multiple manufacturing processes. I imagine they've got that optimized pretty well.

"come to was a shifting of the incidence of economic exploitation upon themselves\u2026\nThe [Constitutional] convention was made up wholly of men representing the economic interests of the first division. The great majority of them, possibly as many as four-fifths, were public creditors; one-third were land-speculators; some were moneylenders; one-fifth were industrialists, traders, shippers; and many of them were lawyers. They planned and executed a coup d\u2019\u00c9tat, simply tossing the Articles of Confederation into the wastebasket, and drafting a constitution de novo.\nNock despised plutocratic Conservatism, and rightly saw Herbert Hoover as the embodiment of this point of view. Understanding the big business origins of statism in modem America, Nock heaped scorn upon the conservatives who joined him in opposing the New Deal which they themselves had prefigured.\nAbove all, Albert Jay Nock hated militarism and intervention into foreign wars, and he opposed staunchly not only World Wars I and II but also, and with particular vehemence, America\u2019s aggressive invasion of Soviet Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution.\nThere is no space here to discuss Albert Nock\u2019s great contributions to political thought and analysis: his use of Franz Oppenheimer\u2019s distinction between the \u201ceconomic means\u201d and the \u201cpolitical means,\u201d and his analysis of the State as the organization of the latter; his view of history as essentially a race between State power and social power; his opposition to compulsory mass education. Suffice it to conclude that Nock was an authentic American radical, in the great tradition stemming from Henry Thoreau. His only error was his deep-seated pessimism about any real improvement in the modern world; although considering what many of his present day epigones have made of him, his pessimism might well be justified.\nMurray Newton Rothbard was an American heterodox economist of the Austrian School, economic historian and political theorist.

"\nThis charismatic cheesecake is a specialty at the world's largest Benihana restaurant located in the Hilton hotel and casino in Las Vegas. Check it out: The lightly orange-flavored, fluffed-up cream cheese sits on layer of soft white cake, the edge is frosted and coated with crunchy hazelnut crumbs, and the top is covered with wedges of mandarin oranges in an orange-flavored gelatin. Every element of my Benihana Mandarin Cheesecake recipe is made from scratch, and the finished product is well worth the work you put in.\nFor the cake layer, we whip up just enough of a simple white cake batter to fit into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. The cheese layer in our clone is created with a special custom combination of gelatin, Dream Whip and cream cheese so that no baking is required to firm it up. You could, of course, use a store-bought white frosting for the edge of the cake, but since you only need a small amount of frosting, the clone recipe here makes it cheaper.\nThe hazelnuts are candied with sugar and reduced to crumbs in a food processor. You can find a 1/2-cup bag of chopped hazelnuts in most supermarkets that are perfect for this. And two 15-ounce cans of mandarin orange wedges is just the right amount for garnishing the top. Just be sure to save 1/2-cup of the liquid from the cans of orange wedges to create the gel that holds the topping in place.\nComplete the Benihana experience with my copycat recipes for their Japanese onion soup, ginger salad dressing, fried rice, and hibachi chicken and steak with dipping sauces.\nBoston Market Meatloaf\nIn the early 90's Boston Chicken was rockin' it.

"Wiley-Blackwell\nAuthor: Michael Hand\nMichael Hands\u2019 short pamphlet asks what philosophers can offer to the debate about teaching patriotism in schools. The usual objection is that it is too difficult to do well. Hands\u2019 prefers a deeper objection: there are \u201cno rational grounds\u201d for determining whether or not patriotism does more harm than good. Schools can therefore do no more than teach patriotism as a controversial subject, and allow pupils to decide for themselves. Hands\u2019 utilitarian case for staying on the fence on the value of patriotism as a social good is unconvincing. If we want civic, not ethnic, versions of national identity to underpin our common citizenship, then this depends on being in favour of the version of patriotism and belonging that we need. Most attention is given to the argument that patriotism clouds and impedes the judgement of citizens to do their civic duty, yet there has never been any shortage of projects for change \u2013 from Wilberforce and Equino\u2019s movement to abolish slavery, the US civil rights movement, or the \u201cnow win the peace\u201d case for post-war welfare \u2013 founded in patriotic critiques of the status quo.\nMost who think patriotism is worth getting off the fence for will also agree that the author\u2019s objection to patriotic indoctrination in schools is valid. But how many contemporary voices are promoting a tub-thumping and biased account of British history to re-establish or invent national myths? That would certainly be an unfair caricature of Education Secretary Michael Gove. His argument for an overarching sense of the narrative sweep of British history is surely compatible with teaching it, warts and all. What it does require is some priority to finding sufficient space in the curriculum for British history, alongside the European dictators, or Geronimo and the American West. And it depends too on getting over any fear that teaching the history of Empire and decolonisation openly and accurately will be divisive in multi-ethnic classrooms, when it is an essential foundation for understanding the history that has made us the society that we have become.<s> The Legend of Jerry Zifcak \u2013 The Pride of Burrillville Broncos Hockey\nJohn Zifcak was"

We have learnt the value here of simple pleasures, we\u2019ve enjoyed the moors and the flowers and the birds and the stars and all the beautiful things that Nature can give us.

Although there are some positive uses for environmental covenants, they have generally been applied as a means for the polluter to avoid the costs and liability of site remediation.\nOutcome: Passed in the House, but defeated in the Senate.\nHB 462 Tax Increment for Development Act more\nSummary: HB462 and its companion SB495 authorize the establishment of tax-increment financing (TIF) districts to promote revitalization and redevelopment.

"investigating the source of the funds.\n\u201cFor the last four to five Tuesdays, an inventory has been taken of all his cupboards, which were kept locked,\u201d said BPP chairman Dinshaw Mehta. Colah, who was suffering from cancer and passed away in December 2013, was the trustee of various trusts, agiaries and anujumans.\nOn Thursday, BPP trustee Muncherji Cama sent out an email to fellow trustees stating, \u201cSince the BPP has been unable to investigate the title and origin of the contents of Mehli\u2019s cupboard opened in the presence of two trustees and staff on Tuesday afternoon, I reiterate that the matter be handed to the police.\u201d\nMehta said the source of the funds might have been from the sale of shares or may have been kept in \u201csafe custody\u201d by the BPP after a community member passed away without any legal heirs.\nHowever, community activist Kersi Randeria linked it to an earlier controversy regarding a Bora Bazaar property, which was transferred in lieu of the trust receiving Rs 65 lakh. At the time, co-trustees, Khojeste Mistree, Yazdi Desai and Jimmy Mistree, had filed a complaint against Mehta with the economic offences wing for misappropriating a part of the transfer fee.\nRanderia questioned why the Colah\u2019s cupboards had not been accessed for nine months and pointed out that when a community member dies without a will, the BPP has to follow an established legal process before taking possession of the individual\u2019s personal effects. Mehta, however, reiterated that everything was \u201clegal\u201d.

"Sportster is now in its 62nd consecutive model year. The formula of rebellious minimalism, powered by a lusty V-twin engine, has remained throughout\u2014albeit with periodic upgrades in performance, ride quality, comfort, braking, electrics, emissions, and reliability.\nVarious features have accompanied the Sportster through the years. One is the air-cooled, pushrod, 45-degree V-twin, which began as an iron-head carbureted unit and is now a fuel-injected aluminum mill. Another is the twin shorty mufflers, which debuted in the early 1960s. And a third element is a low seat (currently 25.5 inches), an essential feature for a bike called a Superlow! In practice, this makes the Sportster 1200 a confident perch for shorter riders, reasonably easy to ride, and a fun all-around city/highway steed. Although the Superlow is low on the air-cooled H-D ladder, it is hardly a lesser machine. After all, it\u2019s still a Sportster.\nLikes: Like the Corvette is America's sports car, the Sportster is America's cruiser.\nDislikes: When compared to rival bikes with selectable ride modes or DTC gearboxes, the Sportster is old tech.\nVerdict: When you have a Sportster Superlow, you have the real deal.\n2018 Harley-Davidson Sportster SuperLow Specs and Pricing\nDISPLACEMENT 883cc\nWET WEIGHT 569 lb.\nMore Buyer's Guide\n2022 Royal Enfield Meteor 350\n2022 BMW R nineT Scrambler\n2022 BMW R nineT/Pure\n2021 Honda Rebel 300\nRunning Against the Wind\n2023 Indian Roadmaster, Springfield, and Super Chief First Look\nDucati Retools Scrambler Series for 2023\nRoyal Enfield Pulls Wraps Off New Super Meteor 650\n2023 Ducati Diavel V4"

"characteristics. Overall, 4800 new cases were identified, at a rate of 4 cases per 10 000 workers. A high proportion was under 25 y.o., and female. The largest number and rate of WRCTS cases were identified in the manufacturing sector. High rates were also seen in technical/administrative operations using video display units. The combined use of PR and WC reports identified far more cases in MA than had been indicated by either system alone. The study is limited by underreporting by both workers and physicians. High numbers of reported cases for a given worksite reflect either a high prevalence of risk factors, or simply better reporting rates. While physician reports help identify establishments where intervention is needed, WC reports are more reliable for targeting specific occupations and industries. Future research is needed to identify factors influencing reporting rates. Improvements in reporting will allow for more accurate assessment of the costs incurred by WRCTS upon society\n4.

(2000).\nThis neurosurgical review from Louisiana State University Medical Center provides the clinician with a clearly-outlined approach to the patient with nerve injury. In a succinct, yet comprehensive manner, the authors describe key aspects of the clinical evaluation and appropriate electrodiagnostic/radiographic studies including EMG, NCS, x-ray, CT myelogram, and MRI, for various cases. Valuable diagnostic questions are provided. A discussion of surgical versus conservative treatment includes timing factors, contraindications to surgery, and details of operative procedures. Early surgery is advised for open lacerations involving clean nerve transactions. A delay is suggested for bluntly transected nerves, or lesions-in-continuity. Advanced microsurgical techniques and introperative electrophysiologic measures such as nerve action potentials (NAP) have led to more accurate diagnoses and positive surgical outcomes. The operative procedures discussed include internal and external neurolysis, split repair, end-to-end epineurial repair,"

"istic at which to take in all one\u2019s surroundings\u2014the desire for an efficiency that will meet the demands of his modern life. A heuristic is something that enables us to solve practical problems quickly and efficiently. Two concomitant movements or processes are captured by this idea\u2014on the one hand, an abstract process, which pursues the possibilities of understanding something more globally; on the other hand, an empirical response to knowledge gained through one\u2019s experience of a local environment. Insofar as it promises a shorthand for navigation, the Traveling Salesman Problem is by extension a problem of heuristics. The salesman-flaneur\u2019s predicament has to do as much with his physical movement as with the figurative calculation that one can imagine charts his path. Hovers\u2019s rendering of this scenario explores how the way we think consider problem that would seem abstract\u2014the map and the city\u2013provide models (heuristics of a sort) for how we as individuals navigate more local \u2018territories\u2019 of space and image.\nHovers captures the uncertainty in a traveler whose very movement should, in \u2018theory\u2019\u2014in the fantastic tale of the heuristic\u2014be as certain as the direction of a vector on a graph. She captures the moment of disorientation at the core of a restless efficiency that cannot, contrary to the promise of the algorithm, find footing in a resolvable calculation. To this photographic capture of the flaneur\u2019s halted progress Hovers supplements the poetic demonstrations of what we can imagine as imaginary cartographies for the salesman and his flaneur foil. In these searching iterations we receive something like an informational climate or visual score to the rest of the piece. From an experiment devised to reveal complete efficiency and certainty, Hovers extracts playfulness. The artist\u2019s camera takes perspectives that both expose and evade, expressing a poetry that emerges around the figures in her works, even when they themselves seem at odds with it. Her visual techniques present an ideal ofpoetic clarity that ends up displacing algorithmic clarity. For the illusory clarity offered by the algorithm Hovers substitutes the true clarity of a poetic excavation of information, and a revelation of the infinite uncertainties lurking beneath what seems"

Application to a farm newspaper received a call from the owner requesting an interview.\nIt was a freezing December morning when the recent graduate with wife and baby remaining in the car was interviewed.\nNaivety and low-level applicant knowledge were quite apparent with the newspaper owner-interviewer readily noticing the other family members shivering outside.\nSomehow, someway, maybe feeling sorry for kids, the grocery carryout boy-wannabe cowboy was hired to be a professional newspaperman.\nIt was really a perfect job, meeting people, writing stories, while continuing to develop personal ranching and horse business.

But in those first few hours of war, Marine Lance Corporal Jose Antonio Gutierrez became the second casualty and died in Southern Iraq at the young age of 22.\nGutierrez was an orphan from Guatemala who survived on the streets until he made his escape on freight trains and eventually illegally entered the US from Mexico at age 14. He slept on park benches and ate at shelters until a social worker was able to move Gutierrez into a foster home.\nIn 2000, Gutierrez finally found some rest with his fourth foster parents Nora and Marcelo Mosquera (who were immigrants from Costa Rica and Ecuador). He attended high school and then played soccer for Harbor College where he studied architecture. He sometimes joked to his family that someday \u201cpeople"
"it services.\nColoski December 10, 2020 / 8:32 pm\nI feel like this year it is the colorado resorts and next year they\u2019ll do tahoe or something\nGiven that Vail has built 0 lifts at Kirkwood since its acquisition in 2012, 2 at Northstar since its acquisition in 2010, and 5 at Heavenly since its acquisition in 2002, I do not have high hopes. 7 lifts over a combined 36 years is not a great track record for 3 resorts each with double-digit lift fleets, respectively. I really do wish Vail invested more in Tahoe, but my best hope at the moment is for Alterra to convert more skiers over to Ikon by either combining Squaw/Alpine and having a big marketing campaign or buying/partnering with another Tahoe resort (Sugar Bowl, Sierra-at-Tahoe, Mt. Rose) and forcing Vail\u2019s hand.\nRyan December 10, 2020 / 11:26 pm\nWhat at Tahoe needs fixing?\nskitheeast December 11, 2020 / 1:32 am\nHeavenly: It takes two slow lifts and 20+ minutes to get out of Boulder Lodge. I know a single, long lift may be too expensive or whatnot, but a detachable from the base up to somewhere above Stagecoach to at least allow for a two high-speed lift ride would be an improvement. Galaxy is relatively new, but not being detachable is ridiculous considering the length ad terrain it serves. There needs to be a second lift out of California back over to Nevada for when Sky goes down.\nNorthstar: The parking situation is a mess, and the Castle Rock gondola is really needed. The transition between Lookout and the rest of the resort is still iffy, even with the platter being in place. Comstock could use a capacity upgrade, possibly with its bottom terminal moved uphill to avoid the runout on Cascade around Rendezvous. Northstar also lacks the terrain diversity of other Tahoe mountains that cannot be solved without an expansion"
"\nShooting on Location: Working with Available Light\nShooting on Location: Q&A\nStudent Headshot Demo Part 1\nPosing Large Groups Demo\nRemember we talked about Speedlites and how it's difficult to find things to make them sit on a light stand without breaking the bottom of them off? These are for Manfrotto, and these are absolutely fantastic. These are, again, in the gear guide for the course. This is, sort of, the most elegant solution I have found out there in the universe to get a Speedlite to affix to a light stand. Why don't we demonstrate? So let's take a light stand, and I'm going to do this nice and slow so they can get a good shot of it. I was shooting with a friend one time at a wedding, and she had one of these and I said \"Where did you get that?\" She said \"I saw it at the camera store. Just came out. \"They just started carrying them.\" Now there is a little hitch. You will need to purchase whatever these things are called and these are just a couple of bucks, but they have the different size threads in the top and bottom that's an adapter for you to be able to put them into the top of a light stand. By defa...\nult, your Manfrottos, these particular ones, will have that large thread. Some light stands have a small thread, like so. But the difference is that these guys right here, they have, they're not completely cylindrical, they have a little chunk taken out of the edge, it's flat on one side. And to use these adapters, to use these Manfrotto adapters, you need to have this guy right here, where it's flat on one side, or else these will not close properly on them. See how it's flat on one side? So you want to make sure that you have these, these are only a couple of bucks extra, and they're little plastic bags in the camera store, you can get them anywhere. So, going to screw those right on top, and now instead of any kind of clunky, twirly thing, you literally just put them on top, and it works.

At the time, privacy advocates warned of the potential risks of letting businesses collect genetic databases.\nPrivacy advocate Jeremy Gruber summed it up in 2010 when he said that genetic material \u201chas serious information about you and your family.\u201d This information, if used beyond the purposes of genealogy tracing, has big implications in law enforcement and government tracking. Wired magazine cautioned, \u201cYour relative\u2019s DNA could turn you into a suspect.\u201d\nCurrently, the FBI keeps a national genetic database of the DNA of convicts and arrestees. Both companies\u2019 privacy policies state that upon court order, DNA information will be given to law enforcement. Yet, as Wired implicated, people have been wrongly accused of crimes for DNA near-matches in the past.\n23andMe recently launched a transparency report, similar to other major tech companies that receive government requests for consumer information, within the next month.\n\u201cIn the event we are required by law to make a disclosure, we will notify the affected customer through the contact information provided to us, unless doing so would violate the law or a court order,\u201d said the company\u2019s first privacy officer Kate Black.\nAncestry.com will not state explicitly how many government data requests the company has recieved.\n\u201cOn occasion when required by law to do so\u2026 we have cooperated with law enforcement and the courts to provide only the specific information requested,\u201d said a spokesperson.\nArticle via Fusion, October 16, 2015\nPhoto: DNA isolation 5 via Patrick Alexander [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs]\nSocial Security card renewal to be made available online\nNovember 21, 2015"

"to get vaccinated? Here\u2019s where the state of safe vaccines for children stands now.\nCurrently, there are no COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in children under the age of 16. But experts are hopeful that older children will be able to be vaccinated by fall, with younger kids following early next year. If you have a child 16 and older, you can begin looking for an appointment for them at VaccineFinder.org, but the appointment must be for a Pfizer dose.\nWhat Ages Are the Current Vaccines Authorized For?\nVaccines in the U.S. must undergo a rigorous testing process, including three phases of clinical trials, under the guidance of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in order to be authorized for use.\nCDC Identifies Children at High Risk for COVID-19\nCurrently, only the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for children aged 16 and up. Both Moderna and Johnson & Johnson are currently only available to those who are 18 and older.\nWhy? Only Pfizer-BioNTech included people as young as 16 in clinical trials, Russo explains. The others only included participants as young as 18. None of the vaccine makers included children under those ages in their clinical trials.\nNext Steps in COVID-19 Vaccine Clinical Trials\nAll of the companies with COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. are currently testing their vaccines on children, or plan to do so.\nPfizer is doing two clinical trials: one in children between the ages of 12 and 15 and another for children as young as six months.\nOn March 31, Pfizer-BioNTech shared results from their phase 3 clinical trial on children between 12 and 15 showing that their vaccine had a 100% efficacy rate in participants and was well tolerated.

Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on.

Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction--Gatsby who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the \"creative temperament\"--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.

This open-label, randomized, 5-way crossover study was conducted in 40 subjects (aged 19 - 45 y). Diclofenac (75 mg taken orally twice daily), DETP (1.3% applied topically twice daily), or ibuprofen (800 mg taken orally thrice daily) was administered for 3 consecutive days, followed by co-administration with furosemide (given intravenously as 20 mg/2 min). Plasma furosemide and NSAID concentrations, urine furosemide, sodium and potassium concentrations and urine output were determined throughout the 24 h period following furosemide administration. Orally administered ibuprofen significantly increased furosemide AUC(0-t) (37%) and AUC(0-inf) (36%) and decreased total body CL (27%), R(max) (19%) and CLR (23%) geometric mean ratios compared with furosemide control. Oral and topical diclofenac had no pharmacokinetic effects on furosemide. Ibuprofen increased sodium excretion (Ae(0-24), 16%) and decreased sodium R(max) (15%), and oral diclofenac decreased urine output (Vu(0-24), 15%). DETP had no effect on furosemide pharmacodynamics; total systemic exposure to diclofenac during DETP treatment was diclofenac. Treatments were generally safe, with 25 subjects reporting a total of 112 adverse events. Pharmacodynamic effects were seen with oral diclofenac (urine output) and ibuprofen (urine sodium excretion).

Because of the high oil content of the elemi resins, the term was used in the 17th and 18th centuries to describe many oleoresin mixtures. Currently the most common is Manila elemi, a malleable resin with a pungent odor obtained from the Pili trees, Canarium luzonicum and Canarium communis, of the Philippines. Other elemi resins come from Amyris elemifera (Egypt) and Elaphirium elemiferum (Mexico). Elemi has been used as a plasticizer in varnishes, but the components responsible for its initial malleability (mono- and sesquiterpenoids) evaporate and it eventually hardens to a brittle film. Elemi is used in lithographic inks, textile coatings, paper coatings, perfume bases, and waterproofing.\nFTIR(MFA)\nelemi (Deut., Esp., It., Pol.); elemi gum; Luzon; Manila elemi; Nauli elemi; gum elemi; canarium; elemi resin\nSoluble in ethanol, ether, chloro"
"to customers, the mass drugstore hopes to encourage realism in beauty marketing.\nDove's mantra, \"Beauty is for everyone,\" really rings true in its marketing. The Dove Beauty Pledge consists of three vows: 1. The brand will always feature real women, never models (with diverse ages, sizes, and ethnicities in mind); 2. The brand portrays women as they are in real life (there is zero digital distortion of women and every image is approved by the women featured); 3. The brand funds the Dove Self-Esteem Project, a community of mentors, teachers, and educators that help young girls bolster confidence.\nIn February 2020, Olay announced it is officially committed to \"zero skin retouching\" in all of its advertising materials, including content created by Olay's influencer partners. In a statement, the brand admits that women face outrageous, and often conflicting, expectations about their appearance from the beauty industry and society as a whole: \"In the U.S., 40 percent of women surveyed by Mintel said they felt beauty advertisements impart an unrealistic expectation, making it unclear what was actually achievable.\" Olay's campaign to leave photos untouched will be led by actor Busy Philipps, model Denise Bidot, and comedian Lilly Singh. Going forward, the company's advertisements will be paired with an Olay Skin Promise logo, assuring customers that the photo is sans Photoshop. This rolling plan is expected to culminate across the entire brand by 2021.\nSPKTRM Beauty\nFounded in 2018 by Jasmine Glass, Annaliisa Benston, and Ehlie Luna, SPKTRM Beauty is the first beauty brand to ban model retouching entirely. Its mission: to throw all unrealistic beauty standards and limitations out the window. Upon its initial launch, the brand promised to never digitally alter the appearance of its models and present their products on a gender-inclusive cast of models in order to reveal how well the products work on everyone.\nWe can all agree that Rihanna is a pioneer, but what deserves the most applause is probably the level of inclus"

It had agreed to defer the removal proceedings in Aug 2013.\nThe commissioner's office will seek representations from them on why they should not be removed. \"The COC will consider fully and fairly all representations received before making a decision,\" it said in a statement late Wednesday.\n\"The six individuals who were convicted of offences involving dishonesty or deception are automatically disqualified from being a governing board member, key officer or trustee of CHC,\" the COC added.\nIt said the removal proceedings do not remove any of these individuals from their religious duties. \"Pastor Kong may continue with his religious duties, as this is separate from the holding of any governance or management positions in CHC,\" the COC stated.\nThe church can also continue its normal services, collect offerings during its weekly services, and conduct fund-raising appeals subject to compliance with existing regulations, the COC said.\nCity Harvest trial: Church founder Kong Hee and five others were convicted of all charges levelled against them on...\nCity Harvest Church (Official) trial: All 6 found guilty on all charges.\"The evidence points overwhelmingly to a...\nKong Hee 'key man behind church scandal'\nKong Hee exaggerated the success of his wife's music career, was in control of the supposedly independent firm that managed her, and played a key part in misleading auditors and lawyers.\nAnd critically, it was his approval and guidance that was sought by his five accomplices in their misuse of City Harvest Church (CHC) funds.\nThis was what Judge See Kee Oon said of Kong, the church's founder, in his 270-page written judgment obtained by The Straits Times yesterday - making clear that it was the 51-year-old who was first and foremost behind the scandal.\nOn Wednesday, the judge convicted Kong, former CHC fund manager"

"simple as changing schools can be deeply traumatic to some children.In fact, depression can express itself as rage and anger in teenagers, said Col. Steve Cozza, USA, Ret., a professor of psychiatry and associate director of the Study of Traumatic Stress at the Uniformed Services University.Parents may not realize their children need help until it\u2019s too late.That\u2019s particularly troubling, Rauch and Cozza agreed, because a recent study found that as many as 30 percent of teenagers have had suicidal thoughts.That number is slightly higher for military children.No one should look at those figures as solely a military problem, however, Rauch said.Compounding the problem is a nationwide shortage of mental health services for children.Col. Rebecca Porter, commander of Dunham Health Clinic at Carlisle Barracks, Pa., said tele-behavioral health is becoming more available, in part to offset that shortage.She said the Army Surgeon General is adding a child and family behavioral health service to its behavioral health service line over the next three years.It includes \"intervention in consultation with primary care providers.So many behavioral health needs that come into our treatment facilities come in through primary care.They don\u2019t start in specialty care clinics,\" Porter said.Another component of the new program involves community outreach. Behavioral health providers will be available in the schools and on installations to work with educators.

", such as cranberry juice and dietary supplements, \u200bmay help prevent \u2014 but not treat \u2014 urinary tract infections\u200b. Some studies suggest that drinking 240 to 300 milliliters of cranberry juice every day may prevent recurring UTIs in half of the cases.\nResearchers state that \u200bcranberries may cause adverse reactions\u200b, from nausea and elevated blood sugar to acid reflux. Additionally, these fruits may interact with warfarin.\nThe review featured in Advances in Nutrition revealed some interesting findings. It appears that \u200bcarbonated soft drinks increase the risk of UTIs\u200b, while cranberry juice protects the urinary tract. Another research article, which was published in \u200bPlos One\u200b in August 2018, found that \u200bpropolis enhances the effects of cranberry against \u200bE. coli\u200b\u200b, the bacterium responsible for a large majority of UTIs.\nIf you suspect you have a UTI, consult with your doctor to get the needed treatments. If you have chronic UTIs, your doctor may also be able to provide some insight as to whether you would benefit from adding cranberry juice to your diet as a preventive measure.\nFruit Juices and Your Weight\nBoth cranberry and Concord grape juice benefit your health when consumed in moderation. These beverages are a better choice than soda, but they still contain quite a lot of sugar.\nA single serving (half a cup) of grape juice provides 76 calories and 18.6 grams of carbs, including 17.9 grams of sugar. The same amount of cranberry juice contains 15.3 grams of sugar. If you drink two cups of grape juice, that's an extra 71.6 grams of sugar.\nThe natural sugars in fruit juice have the same impact on your health \u2014 and your waistline \u2014 as refined sugar. Consume these beverages in moderation to maintain your figure and prevent weight gain.\nFrom a nutritional standpoint, fruit juice has a \u200bsimilar sugar content and caloric value\u200b"

These specific codes ensure that no payment gets transferred to the wrong beneficiary. It is the precision and the vast network of FEDERAL BANK that ensures payments happen instantly and FEDERAL BANK is able to transfer funds between two parties without any hassles.\nThe RBI keeps reviewing their available list of IFSC codes, and makes necessary modifications in case a need comes across. You can take a look at the IFSC code list by visiting RBI\u2019s official site that has the IFSC codes for FEDERAL BANKs and other.\nThere are various sublet branches in Pondicherry which in turn refers to small banks, like co-operative banks that aren\u2019t allotted IFSC codes that are accessible via bank names and branch.

From this, one can easily derive a polynomial-time algorithm for sorting signed circular permutations by SSOs: it suffices to cut the circular permutation (n different cuts are possible), and to decide which extremity is left and which is right (2 possible cases). Once this is done, we are left with a linear permutation, which can be sorted using cyclic SSOs using Algorithm 1. The sorting distance is the minimum value obtained by Algorithm 1 over the 2n possible linear permutations obtained from the circular one. Thus we have the following result.\nSorting signed circular permutations by SSOs is in \\(\\mathsf {P}.\\)\nComputing a sorting sequence\nAlgorithm 1 only returns the length of a minimum-length sorting sequence, not the sequence itself.

These transitions pose challenges for all people, but especially for people on the autism spectrum. Studies show that both the transition to higher education and from higher education to work pose certain difficulties for them. At the same time, the aim is to promote the diversity of higher education and a smoother work transition. The support of the universities has been found to promote both the progress of studies and skills important in studies. The purpose of this Master\u2019s thesis was to look at speech related to support for students on the autism spectrum at universities. The research material consisted of six interviews in which two career services employees, two university teachers, and both current and graduate students on the autism spectrum were interviewed. The interviews were originally part of the Improving Employability of Autistic Graduates in Europe (IMAGE) project. The six interviews were selected for use in this thesis together with the researcher involved in the project. The research material was analyzed by discourse analysis. As a result of the analysis, three discourses were outlined, which were named similarization discourse, individualization discourse, and individualistic discourse. The subject positions of students on the autism spectrum transitioning to work, were outlined through substance- and special skills and without individualistic agency. These subject positions did not fully meet the individualistic expectations of employers, or the support formed based on these expectations.\nKorkeakouluopiskelijoiden uupumuksen ehk\u00e4iseminen psykologisen joustavuuden avulla \ufeff\nPoranen, Nea (2022)\nMore and more university students are experiencing symptoms of burnout.

The cinema can benefit from HDTV broadcasts, since additional sources of income can be developed outside of the core business . Special events such as sports broadcasts and concerts can be broadcast live in cinemas, as receivers for digital signals can be easily integrated into the existing digital cinema equipment. And even if the resolution of HDTV does not match that of 4K, it can still be better than if the signal of a conventional television broadcast or a 720p broadcast were projected onto the screen .\nStereoscopy (3D TV)\nFull-color anachrome image\nUnder stereoscopy is any technique that is capable of transmitting three-dimensional visual information with two-dimensional images and awaken the impression of real spatial depth in the viewer. The spatial impression in photos or films is created by two superimposed single images that were taken from two slightly different positions (usually eye relief). In the cinema or television, these 3D films were only rarely used for special presentations, because firstly, the production of the 3D films is more complex and therefore more expensive and because special anaglyph, polarizing or electronically controlled 3D glasses had to be used to view these films . that not every viewer owns and does not want to wear for every broadcast. In the 1950s, 3D cameras were popular for horror films and documentaries were primarily filmed in stereo 3D. These films can also be transferred from celluloid to digital media and in HD resolution, or they can be recorded digitally in HD. From spring 2007, for example, there was a 3D cinema in Cologne's Cinedom with hourly films similar to the IMAX-3D, but projected with a 3D-DLP digital projector. The 3D glasses used there (initially electronic LCD shutter, now Dolby 3D in four halls) are very light and can almost be confused with polarization glasses.

"Center, analyzed the data.\n\"I initially noticed a slightly lighter vertical shaft that caught my eye in the Navcam,\" said Rice. \"In the original version, it was pretty tough to see, but I examine all of our images - Hazcams, MIs, Navcams, and Pancams - from the rovers very carefully, and scan over them, line by line,\" he added.\nWhen Rice zoomed in that lighter vertical shaft, his hunch was confirmed. \"It was a dust devil,\" he said.\n\"We really don't see many dust devils at Meridiani, so it's a pretty rare event,\" said Squyres. In fact, while Spirit captured a good number of dust devils with her cameras, this is only the second dust devil Opportunity has seen and the first one seen at Endeavour Crater. As a result, the rover would be assigned to dust devil watch later in the month.\nThe following sol, 3183 (January 6, 2013), Opportunity had a brief bout of \"amnesia,\" similar, the MER ops team thinks, to the bouts Spirit suffered in 2009. The engineers immediately zeroed in on corruption in the Flash file system, used by the rover for non-volatile telemetry storage, as the probable cause. \"We suspect there is a sector that controls a block that is becoming corrupted,\" confirmed Callas.\nInterestingly, when they looked back through the record, the MER ops engineers found that there have been four amnesia events over a 100-sol period, on Sols 3082 (September 24, 2012), 3161 (December 15, 2012), 3178 (January 1, 2013), and 3183, and none since then, Callas informed. \"We didn't notice at first because they were relatively benign and they all happened lat at night when the rover wakes up to turn off the APXS and [effectively shut down to] go into Deep Sleep, or what we call mini-DeepSleep, because it doesn't DeepSleep all night,"

She walked into the Upper Fifth Form room one Monday morning, looking very shy and lost and strange, and stood forlornly, not knowing where to sit, till somebody took pity on her, and pointed to a vacant desk. It happened to be on a line with Ingred\u2019s, and the latter watched her settle herself. She looked her over with the critical air that is generally bestowed on new girls, and decided that she was particularly pretty. Bess was the image of one of the Sir Joshua Reynolds\u2019 child angels in the National Gallery. The likeness was so great that her mother had always cut and curled her golden-brown hair in exact copy of the picture. She was a slim, rosy, bright-eyed, smiling specimen of girlhood, and, though on this first morning she was manifestly afflicted with shyness, she had the appearance of one whose acquaintance might be worth making. Ingred decided to cultivate it at the earliest opportunity, and spoke to the new arrival at lunchtime. Bess replied readily to the usual questions.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve only come lately to Grovebury. We used to live at Birkshaw. Yes, I\u2019m fairly keen on hockey, though I like tennis better. Have you asphalt courts here, and do you play in the winter? I adore dancing, but I hate gym. I\u2019m learning the violin, and I\u2019m to start oil-painting this term.\u201d\nShe seemed such a pleasant, winsome kind"
"and hopped onto a trolley to go down town and celebrate with the whole world. When Grandma explained that Hitler was dead, I knew my morning marches around the dining room table had been successful.\nI understood, at age five, the jubilant day meant my dear Aunt Mawgy would be home soon, but it didn\u2019t happen quite that fast and not quickly enough to please my family. We still did not receive any letters from her or hear of her whereabouts until shortly before Christmas. I can\u2019t imagine, now, what the adults in my family must have feared.When Aunt Mawgy finally called from Manhattan, she had just reached shore, but didn\u2019t arrive\nin New Albany until January 1946. She explained she wasn\u2019t allowed to leave Frankfort, Germany, until nearly the last of the transport ships departed for America because they had to set up POW hospitals and train the German staff. She spent Thanksgiving somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, dining on a savoury wedge of lettuce with mayonnaise on top. She also had gone months and months without mail or pay checks, and had left Germany with ten dollars to her name. Aunt Mawgy brought me two dolls from Belgium, a boy and girl in regional dress, wearing wooden shoes. The girl carried a basket from which a goose poked its head out from under the lid. Now, I think, she perhaps represented B\u00e9cassine, a French comic character.\n(Above is a photo of Anne\u2019s artwork of a pair of Belgium dolls in regional dress, wearing wooden shoes. My caption of their provenance written after 1946: \u201cAunt Mawgy gave me these dolls.\nShe got them in Brussels when she was over-seas.\u201d)\nMeanwhile, between the flooding in March and the end of summer, my mother and grandfather went house hunting. Their criteria for the right place included a safe neighbourhood for me, with an affordable and suitably large house, situated high above the floodplain.

"It\u2019s another exercise in re-reading, albeit a painful one.\nBut it\u2019s something I\u2019d at least like to at least start. Most of my updates have a pretty clear motivation: show why Apple isn\u2019t a threat, explain how we can build with empathy, or talk about why trust is so important to us. This one has less upside. Admitting the vicissitudes that simultaneously dance and taunt our minds is considered a weakness--and therefore a taboo subject for an update. But the upside is that by sending this, I am living by the ethos I preach around transparency. Footprint will never have anything to hide.\nI\u2019ve wanted to write about vicissitudes for a while. It's why I wrote the above back in August. The reason I\u2019ve been hesitant to publish this is that I don\u2019t know if I agree with it. I certainly don\u2019t live by it. The above is my ode to not getting caught up in the lows or highs. My journal entries are often the contradiction of that idea.\nThere is an interesting view in Daoism that we are born uncarved blocks and each interaction carves a bit off that block. Currently, I am not sure if humans are as permeable. I believe people can grow. But I do in large part think we are creatures of our own creation. And I think we do live by moments. Because moments are not just how we define each day\u2014it is how we define the future and past. We look ahead to events\u2014anniversaries, product launches, etc. We don\u2019t look forward to integrals. That would be really tough to do.\nThe way we resolve this with our past is peak-end theory. But just because we settle something in our mind doesn\u2019t mean we actually resolved it. We can sleep at night, but one stimulus can domino how we came to terms with that past. It is why we can\u2019t neglect the cracks even if we\u2019ve patched them. Maybe this is why I find this update so maddening. Even our memory of the past\u2014which is objectively an integral\u2014we only remember by the derivative that has hijacked our own memory of that period of time.\nThe time may change, but the story doesn\u2019t.

"hockey recruiting, let's just say Marty is not a hockey guy. Back when I talked to him frequently for the newsletter it was clear to me he was much more concerned about season tickets, student behavior, fans traveling to opposing rinks, that sort of thing rather than the nuts and bolts of the game. From what I got back then, he was out of his depth if and when he ever talked about that sort of stuff. But, assuming Marty recognizes he is in a results oriented business, he knows just by walking around the arena on game nights that the public has opted out of UNH Hockey and that a few bells and whistles like the jumbotron are not going to put fannies in the seats. But I'll ask you. How effective do you think he would be going head-to-head with Umile about the quality of the recruits? Not much I would guess. Seriously, he might be wise to hire you as a consultant before he has that talk with Umile and Souza.\nTo me it is a given that Souza will be the coach. He expects it and, I would guess more importantly, his attorney expects it as well. Plus, Marty has never shown any inclination to get rid of people just because they don't win. Chuck may be right when he notes that Marty has to be concerned about the attendance, but Marty has to know that there are no easy ways to fix that problem. Hiring Josh Ciocco or Eric Boguneicki instead of Mike Souza is not going to change that.\nHockeyRef\nOriginally posted by Chuck Murray View Post\nI think 'Watcher's post this morning touches on something that's been overlooked to a degree. Yeah, we all want to see what Souza can do with his recruiting work ... but we also need to look at whether he's shown an ability to \"coach up\" the players he's been left to work with until his own guys begin to arrive on campus. Say what you will about Borek, but we do have a pretty solid baseline from his last several seasons of bringing in mid-level talent and getting them to play at a .500 level in D-1, and slightly above/below that in Hockey East.\nIn the one-plus seasons"

"mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him, but who was considered generous by Society as he fed the people who amused him. His father had been our ambassador at Madrid when Isabella was young and Prim unthought of, but had retired from the diplomatic service in a capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the Embassy at Paris, a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by reason of his birth, his indolence, the good English of his dispatches, and his inordinate passion for pleasure. The son, who had been his father's secretary, had resigned along with his chief, somewhat foolishly as was thought at the time, and on succeeding some months later to the title, had set himself to the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing. He had two large town houses, but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble, and took most of his meals at his club. He paid some attention to the management of his collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of burning wood on his own hearth. In politics he was a Tory, except when the Tories were in office, during which period he roundly abused them for being a pack of Radicals. He was a hero to his valet, who bullied him, and a terror to most of his relations, whom he bullied in turn. Only England could have produced him, and he always said that the country was going to the dogs.

Without government support, that could drop to 36% by the end of this decade, according to the analysis released by U.S. industry body Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and Boston Consulting Group.\nThe United States has already lost its lead in chip manufacturing, prompting the Biden administration to pass the CHIPS and Science Act this year.

One of Chelsea Handler\u2019s Carrie Bradshaw-est moments, where she compares a man\u2019s penis to a poltergeist, sounds like it was written by picking nouns at random out of a bowl. Determined to ruin the manlier aspects of the film too, the shaky action sequences are shot by a cameraman who appears to have a bee inside trousers. One sequence, a strobe light-heavy shootout in a strip club, seems determined to seek out the person in the audience with epilepsy and give them the seizure of a lifetime.\nIn fairness to the actors, the three leads are all up for it, and give their portrayals far more effort than the material deserves. Chelsea Handler brings down the tone enormously however, injecting sheer misery into the film as its \u201ccomic\u201d relief.\nWhile the sabotage scenes are fun, they\u2019re not enough to save a film so utterly out of touch with its audience that when the villain wants to track down the film\u2019s two heroes, he goes to FDR\u2019s London-based tailor to find out where the owner of his one-of-a-kind suits lives.\nNothing can go wrong when we wear suits this nice...\nNo one would care about the film being a sexist tale of the sex-lives of the wealthy if the thing were at least entertaining.

", what we sometimes perceive as play or having fun is actually something else for the mammal. This is true in dolphins, a creature that we generally think of as happy, possibly because of the structure of their jaws that seem locked in a permanent smile. We picture dolphins being playful, jumping in and out of the water. However, this seemingly playful activity can actually be an aggressive behavior. When dolphins leap out of the ocean, it is often because they are fighting with other dolphins and breaking the water surface at high speeds to breathe. But there are other things that dolphins do that scientists believe are forms of play, such as riding on waves for no functional reason or passing around organic objects like seaweed, fish or sea turtles.\nSimilar behavior can be play in animals other than mammals. Fish, frogs and reptiles can have fun. Fish can leap over objects in the water for fun, frog tadpoles ride bubbles, adult frogs sometimes wrestle each other without sexual intentions, and komodo dragons, turtles, and crocodiles play with objects in ways similar to dogs.\nGiven the established role that play seems to have on mammals and other critters, it is surprising to think that invertebrates can also indulge in play. Previously, invertebrates were considered unintelligent and incapable of higher-level actions exhibited by animals with backbones. Yet, an ideal example of play in invertebrates is seen among cephalopods. Octopuses can be seen acting in an exploratory way towards objects by using their arms or siphons to move objects around or playing catch-and-release with their prey the same way a cat would with a mouse. Spiders, another invertebrate, have also been observed exhibiting play behavior. They also engage in non-functional sexual behavior that does not result in conception. At the moment, these observations are preliminary evidence to the argument that invertebrates, too, can play.\nSo why do these animals play? Play can stimulate creative behavior and is hypothesized to have originated when species developed the metabolic capacity as well as increased time and safety for extended activity without functional benefits. As we become less skeptical about"

"connecting the suspension with hydraulics.\nI spoke to renowned race car designer and suspension expert Andy Thorby about the use of just such a system, \u201cI think most or all the teams are using linked hydraulic actuators on the corners.\u201d adding \u201cthey allow you to tune the attitude change of the car under aero load, independently of corner spring rates\u201d by altering both heave and roll stiffness.\nMercedes were one of the many teams to switch to pull rod suspension for 2011, to gain the aero benefits and a lower CofG. With space at a premium at the back of an F1 car, compromises in packaging the various suspension elements need to be made. At its launch it was clear the Mercedes pull rod arrangement placed the rocker quite rearward, in comparison to other pull rod arrangements which place the rocker towards the front of the gear case. The conventional forward rocker placement, puts the heave spring and antiroll in the space at the front of the gear case, packaged around the clutch.\nIn Mercedes case the rocker is packaged the other side of the gear cluster, just under the gearboxes cross shaft. This leaves little room for the antiroll bar and heave spring. It does however place the rocker and torsion bars very low for the benefit of packaging, aero and CofG. Albeit these are small benefits, perhaps Mercedes choice of a short wheel base did not leave space for the suspension to be packaged around the clutch, as the gearbox length is a critical factor in wheelbase length.\nSo left with the lack of space to place either a mechanical heave element or a antiroll bar, it appears that Mercedes have opted to create a passive hydraulic system. This is not to be confused with any form of active suspension or the cars high pressure hydraulic systems, this system will be entirely self contained to remain within the rules on suspension design. As the system reacts only to suspension loads, it is clearly legal and there is no question of interpretation in its acceptance by the FIA.\nWhat Mercedes have in place of a conventional anti roll bar and heave spring are hydraulics units (yellow), which probably also act as the dampers.

For instance, for certain processes the controls or the number of approvals may be more in a PSU as compared to a private sector company. The new age HCMS allows for both audit and control of the processes. Some of our customers such as banks, RBI, stock exchange are very regulated. These products can eliminate a lot more paperwork, streamline HR processes and improve the turnaround in a regulated environment. The Digital footprint for all these processes on the other hand enables audit and control.\nNew age products also provide the users with a creator platform to develop from front end- workflows, forms, surveys, learning content, learning paths etc as per need. This is a natural progression and more sophisticated features will come along as the industry grows.\nAnd how adaptable or customizable do you think the replacement HCMS are? Do they provide integration with the existing standalone systems that organizations have acquired or developed in-house?\nThere are two realities of the market.

Examples may be the CRM system, Supply chain or Finance modules of the existing HCMS.

The finding is promising from a public health policy perspective because misuse of prescription opioids annually contributes to more than 10,000 overdose deaths.\nTwenty-one U.S. states have passed recreational cannabis laws and legislatures in other states are considering similar measures.\n\u201cA reduction in the misuse of opioids will save lives,\u201d said doctoral candidate Shyam Raman who is affiliated with the Cornell Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy and the lead author. \u201cOur research indicates that recreational cannabis laws substantially reduce distribution of codeine to pharmacies, an overlooked potential benefit to legalizing recreational cannabis use.\u201d\nThe study is believed to be among the first to separately examine the impact of recreational cannabis laws on shipments of opioids to hospitals, pharmacies and other endpoint distributors. Previous studies have focused on medical cannabis laws or use of opio"

"talk with Beatrice. Eventually, though, he wants more. He yearns to touch her hair; her dress becomes less a garment of clothing and more a battlement wall. She consumes him. He can\u2019t stay away. It\u2019s here that Hawthorne describes his young protagonist as being \u201cirrevocably within [Beatrice\u2019s] sphere,\u201d forced to \u201cobey the law that whirled him onward, in ever lessening circles.\u201d He, you could say, has it bad.\nPoor Giovanni. Beatrice has poisoned him. This is true: Giovanni soon learns that the girl he loves has infected him, literally infused him with her poison.\nSo what does Giovanni decide to do? He attempts to fix Beatrice. He\u2019s given an antidote that he\u2019s told will cure her. She drinks that antidote, and, as the effects begin to take hold, Dr. Rappaccini, Beatrice\u2019s father, is confounded. He can\u2019t believe it. He, in essence, asks her, \u201cWhy would you give up this power I\u2019ve given you?\u201d I translate this as \u201cWhy would you do this to me?\u201d\n\u201cRappaccini\u2019s Daughter,\u201d published in the 1844 collection Mosses from an Old Manse, is the inspiration for my novel A Fierce and Subtle Poison (the title is a line taken from the story), which comes out (as of the date of this writing) in just a week. What I wanted to do was take a well-known story, examine it, dismantle it, and put it back together. Using different critical angles and lenses, I set out to answer some questions: Do boys still behave a certain way toward the girls with whom they hope to form romantic relationships? Do they still think that girls require \u201csaving\u201d? What about fathers? How do they go about exerting control over their daughters in this day and age? And, of course, what about the girls? What choices do they have now over their bodies that they didn\u2019t have in the past? How are they allowed to leave their \u201cgardens\u201d? What if I changed the setting and the culture\u2014away from an unknown Italy of the past to modern-day Puerto Rico?\nCertain things are similar in both"

The manufacturer claims the new ES7 can go 578 miles on a charge. The Model Y has a range of only 330 miles.\nHowever, with a price tag of $70,000, the sleek new car isn\u2019t a cheap electric solution. NIO, a leading Chinese electric vehicle maker, has designed a pretty fancy car in its ES7.

Not only are all the seats heated, but the front seat even gives you a massage. The S-shaped instrument panel boasts a touchscreen infotainment system and a virtual assistant.

"Manga: Culture, Cooking, and Competition\nOnline Exhibition: Japanese Food Culture: History and Mystery: Food Manga: Culture, Cooking, and Competition\nEnglish Books on Japanese Food: Beyond Cookbooks\nTransformation of Japanese Food\nFood and Dining Culture in the Edo Period Japan\nEast Asian Exhibition\nIt is no exaggeration to say everyone (except babies and toddlers) read manga. Manga genres can be roughly divided by age and gender of the reader, such as boys, girls, young adult, men, women, etc. Also, there are various genres by subject such as action, sci-fi, horror, mystery, love, comedy. . . and food. Often known as gourmet or cooking manga, this genre has become one of the popular genres. Although food is the central theme, the gourmet manga works are diverse and across different genres. Works can be comedy, action, romance, and/or history.\nCooking/Gourmet manga often focuses on a chef, those who cook food in restaurants. So, in this sense, they are manga for professionals who devote their lives to cooking. For example, Aji ichi monme depicts the growth process of a young chef working in a Japanese restaurant. When two chefs are in a contest against each other, the cooking/gourmet manga can be the story of battle. Boys manga depicts food battle stories which sometimes become ridiculously wild. As shown in Yakitate!! Japan, young, genius bread makers show off their extraordinary technique, which is often beyond the ability of human being, who create innovative food which tastes unworldly. The story may also focus on those who eat. The epicurean journalist in Oishinbo does not hesitate to reveal their deep knowledge of food ingredients, thereby providing the readers with the educational information on food. Some manga use food as communication tool. While depicting the daily life of the characters, the story shows what they cook and how they dine together, usually with the recipe of the featured meal. One extraordinary cookbook manga is Danjon-meshi, a fantasy manga which explains how to cook monsters living in a dungeon. Some historical manga introduces"

A 69-year-old female presented with unruptured posterior communicating artery aneurysm and was treated by coil embolization. After the procedure, the patient showed global aphasia and right hemiparesis, and there were small multiple, scattered infarctions on the left middle cerebral artery territory.

CCF is unique in these specifications for both parent companies and brands, and also their strict specification on what can and cannot be used by the brands.\nAlthough their criteria is impressive, don\u2019t expect CCF to perform audits anytime soon on the CCF certified companies. CCF does not conduct compliance audits to ensure the companies are continuing the pledges they made when they registered for CCF certification. Relying on trust of a legally binding contract can leave room for brands to falsely claim cruelty-free status to maintain customers and in turn, reduce reliability of these certifications.\nSo with all these flaws with PETA and CCF, how do we know the best of the best in cruelty-free certifications?

"continuing large scale migration of tourists as a result of the various amenity values of coastal resources, and increasing affluence in some parts of the world has created a need for a different and more comprehensive and widespread approach to their management. In some cases this need arose from experience of the excessive use e.g. overexploited fishing resources, and in others from conflict between uses. No significant part of the world\u2019s coastal area is now without problems. (Kenchigton, 1990). Understanding the nature of conflicting uses of coastal resources, recognising the problem and being willing to do something about it provides a clearer basis for the management actions that follow.\nForemost, the emergence and formulation of coastal management approaches gathered pace in the 1970s. For some decades now, managing coasts has sought frameworks to accommodate changes resulting from global forces.\nDifferent systems abound across the globe, and are variously referred to as Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM), Coastal Zone Management (CZM), and Integrated Coastal Area Management (CAM). Here it is referred to as Coastal Area management because of the wish to emphasis the spatial perspective of multiple uses over the coastal space. Essentially Coastal Area Management is intended to replace the ad hoc crisis responses to marine resource problems with planned, anticipatory and integrated strategies. But to what degree are there frameworks appropriate, and do they achieve a strategic management level?\nCoastal Area Management is most simply understood as management of the CZ as a whole in relation to local, regional, national land international goals. The role of an integrated process and the benefits it brings is important to marrying the marine environment with the terrestrial. It may be defined as\n\u201can integrated or joined up approach towards the many different interest on both the land and marine components of the coasts. It is the process of harmonising the different policies and decision making structures, and bringing together coastal stakeholders to encourage concerted action towards achieving common goals\u201d (DEFRA).\nCoastal Area Management is inevitably a complex process, and the management and implementation, across every continent, is well documented with detailed analysis of demonstrative strengths and weaknesses.

Courtesy of Dana Fry\nThe new South course at Arcadia Bluffs will introduce what many people will think is a new style of golf course architecture when it opens up in northern Michigan in summer 2018.\nThe reality is, the South's linear look - characterized by its square greens and rectangular, steep-faced, flat-bottom bunkers - isn't new at all. The South course is being built as an ode to the Chicago Golf Club. Dating to 1894, the oldest 18-hole club in the United States is also one of golf's most exclusive. Only those with serious connections get to play its classic C.B. MacDonald and Seth Raynor design.\nArchitects Dana Fry and Jason Straka aren't just building another course.

"2001 Cunt-Ups, the author takes her knife to the body of the 1975 Norton Anthology of Poetry, reappropriating William S. Burroughs\u2019 \u201ccut-up\u201d technique. Here, Bellamy takes the original texts from famous poets and injects them with tense and often violent sexual language. The victims of Bellamy\u2019s cu(n)ts cry out their sexual desires and frustrations in an almost schizophrenic, contradicting babble of voices. From the childish commands of Tennyson (\u201cThy pussy is mine mine mine!\u201d) to the submissive whipping boy of Creeley (\u201cYou\u2019re so tough, the way you smack me with your rebuff. I love it\u2026I will wear your panties, will wear whatever dresses your cunt.\u201d), the speakers are multigendered, pansexual slaves (or slavemasters) to their genitals and to the genitals of others. The result is a Frankenstein\u2019s monster of sext, dripping and sutured and not always coherent in its wantings. In Cunt Norton, the men of the western literary canon are stripped and dolled up and forced to expose their most tender pieces. They are forced to smile and giggle and say thank you when Bellamy pushes the knife in. The texts are hers to subjugate and fuck, and by using the poets\u2019 words and styles against them, Bellamy crafts these mutilated self-portraits of shame and pleasure. Take, for example, the natural imagery in \u201cCunt Hughes\u201d used against the poet to question his sexual autonomy and power: \u201cAs you tongue my clit, my pomegranate lips spit proud towns and riches.\u201d Bellamy makes these poets say things with their own words, and she makes them like it.\nCunt Norton works so well because we\u2019ve all been there. As I read these poems, I feel uncomfortable and embarrassed because Bellamy is making these authors say the things they are trying so hard to not say. Things we aren\u2019t supposed to say. Bellamy makes them beg for it. The poets can\u2019t control themselves. Their language has been so"
"been hurt. Apart from her nightmares, Audrey has to deal with other personal issues, including weight gain, alcohol, and others. Loving John Brock could have been the one thing that gave her the ultimate sense of happiness, but this love seems threatened by the ignominy of what happened to her. Can she set herself free from the evil in her past that still haunts her? Sins of Summer by Linda Heavner Gerald is a spellbinding story that explores the power of forgiveness and one woman\u2019s journey towards true freedom.\nIn the opening chapters of this book, the author defines what the story is about in very simple, yet powerful terms: \u201cHow much abuse can a human body and mind endure before breaking? Each one of us responds in our way. This story is about extreme torture of both intellect and physique.\u201d The story is beautifully told and I enjoyed the way the author explored the personality and the psychology of the protagonist, Audrey McGinnis. John Brock is another compelling character and readers will find it delightful to read about these two characters being together. This is an inspirational story with unique originality, told in Linda Heavner Gerald\u2019s inimitable style, and I must warn that there is a lot of \u201ctelling\u201d, of quick reflections about life, and the human condition peppered throughout the story. Sins of Summer has a great and powerful message woven into a beautiful, gritty plot. It is as inspirational as it is fun to read.\nSefina Hawke\nSins of Summer by Linda Heavner Gerald is an inspirational fiction novel that would appeal most to a mixed audience of mature young adults and adults who enjoy stories of redemption and who do not mind darker story elements like rape. Audrey and John Brock began their married life by coming up with a plan where they would spend the first ten years committed solely to their work so that afterwards the couple could retire together in style and travel. After their honeymoon, Audrey went straight into her dream job as an interior designer with her own office, but the happy dream life was not to last.\nSins of Summer by Linda Heavner Gerald was a melancholy read, filled with drama.

"large size of the tumor, they may fill the middle ear cavity and invade the Eustachian tube or mastoid air cells. Most of these tumors are hypervascular and histologically demonstrates numerous vascular channels in a background of a fibrous matrix with an impacted nest of cells separated by a membrane [10]. Their typical appearance on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is of \u201csalt-andpepper,\u201d which reflects the multiple flow void of the larger vascular channels in the tumor [8].\nManagement of such tumors often involves a multi-disciplinary team approach. Often, a combination of treatments is used for the best outcomes. One such accepted treatment option is endovascular embolization of the tumor, followed by surgical resection. Pre-operative embolization is often required to devascularize the hypervascular tumor for better surgical outcomes. Embolization of such tumors is often tedious and requires careful planning, considering the location of the tumor and possible dangerous anastomosis between the feeding arteries with other innocent arteries supplying vital structures in the brain. Another challenge of embolization is the inadvertent spill of embolization material into the non-target vessels, leading to dire consequences [1]. One of such anastomosis can affect the posterior circulation and cause the reflux of the embolization material particles, such as in our patient.\nA 35-year-old female without any significant past medical history was diagnosed with a right glomus tympanicum tumor during workup for the feeling of aural fullness and right ear tinnitus associated with frequent episodes of dizziness for 12 months. The ear tinnitus was pulsatile in nature and not whooshing, buzzing or hissing. With time her hearing on the right ear decreased, and she developed a mild unsteady gait. She had no nausea, vomiting, or other neurological symptoms. Her symptoms virtually disappeared in the subsequent eight months, though this was followed by a recurrence, requiring admission. Notably, she had no past surgical history. Her mother and sister have hearing difficulties. She was divorced, a mother of one child,"
"their next paycheck came from.\nBut there was a catch for the regime. In the occupied territories of the Soviet Union and among the Soviet cultural elite, gradually the ability to game the system grew. Being trusted citizens and ambassadors for their state, they were able to peek outside, learn different modus operandi, became informed of both societal and cultural trends of the free world.\nJazz or the Beatles or heavy metal may have been not openly available, but they were available. Finnish TV was watchable. Radio Free Europe or American Voice were listened to. Radio Luxembourg was listened to. It was more complicated with literature and free media, because their circulation was easier to control, but samizdat \u2013 Soviet people copying forbidden literature on typewriters\u2013 existed.\nCulture kept the regime similarly in check as the regime kept culture in check \u2013 they influenced each other. The thinking of the Soviet Union leadership was influenced by the developments in the free world, as they had no access limitations as normal citizens did. And their belief that what was going on in free west was superior was reinforced by both because they saw economic development which free citizens of the free world were able to produce.\nEveryone knew that this Soviet system was suboptimal for development. The cultural elite made it very clear to the political elite that their support for this regime was conditional. The condition was not only the well-being and guaranteed state-subsidized lifestyle for writers, sculptors, painters, actors and so on. This well-kept and influential, also publicly respected cultural elite would not have supported mass scale brutality and atrocities by Soviet Regime.\nAs Gorbachev\u2019s Glasnost and Perestroika were announced, the cultural elite both supported and lead it \u2013 they tried to use the new, more open program of Communist Party leaders to enforce more freedoms \u2013 freedom of expression, a lack of censorship. But also economic freedoms, because they saw the limitations of the Soviet economic model \u2013 and that only truly free people are creative and entrepreneurial. So they forced the trickle through the dam to become a river until the dam crumbled. It was all quite subtle and gradual, so that the Regime kept believing it was able to reinvent and persist.

But if viewers thought the tension was over for the episode (and I did) the rest becomes a pleasant surprise including giving us plenty of reason to keep watching.\nWhile we might have been expecting an epic fight between Vlad and Van Helsing, the show chooses instead to focus this episode very much on Ton. The fight does occur but what we see of it isn\u2019t epic, Van Helsing is dealt with fairly quickly, and any worry we may have had for the others was fairly wasted. Normally I would be annoyed when a show shot its own cliff-hanger in the foot, except that this anime fairly quickly established that Ton is the one in real trouble this week. By shifting the danger, rather than feeling cheated, I felt a sense of excitement at this unexpectedly interesting development. And while originally I thought Ton and Wayne teaming up was great, it was even more excellent when Wayne was swept away from her and she was left to try to rescue her friend on her own and we were able to see how far she\u2019s grown with using her power since she first entered Cafe Forbidden.\nNow I should probably go on the record as apologising to Ton for giving her such a hard time for being a boring protagonist dragged along by the plot earlier in the series. While she is most definitely still being kicked around by the plot, she is most definitely an active participant in the story at this point and quite a fun one at that. I don\u2019t know when I switched from being indifferent to her and tolerating her to actually enjoying her presence, but this episode wouldn\u2019t have worked unless I had a bit of a care about what was going to happen to"

He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.\nThe electricity cuts began in early August and are especially punishing for Egyptian Muslims left without air conditioning while fasting during daylight hours for the holy month of Ramadan \u2014 including abstaining from water \u2014 as temperatures top 100 degrees (38 Celsius).\nThe protesters said local authorities simply refused to help them.\n\u201cThe officials told us, \u2018Go do whatever you can,\u2019\u201d protester Mustafa Hassan was quoted as"
". The response by the Democrat Delegates on the floor and the response of the chair are their epic insanity and can be viewed at the Globe and Mail here; you can always count on the British to retain things well past their use-by-date and for Beyond the Cusp to recall and use such trivialities. It appears that the Democrats and Team Hillary have learned that it is paramount to get through all of the ugly and difficult to handle items which might reveal the difficulties and other unintended consequences up front and early on so that the Democrat National Convention can be choreographed to run smooth as a Patrick Swayze fight or dance scene. The one question which remains is whether the American public reaches a point where they have a really severe case of Hillary fatigue from which her campaign is incapable of surviving. With the remaining time and the earlier than usual kickoff, we may be about to watch a Hillary burnout where she does not get past and escape all the questions from her past and instead she simply gathers more questions and doubts and eventually is forced from the campaign simply as too much ends up being revealed. The question remains if not Hillary Clinton, then who? There are those calling for Elizabeth Warren and others now claiming that Bernie Sanders would make a formidable campaigner. There are other candidates out there such as Martin O\u2019Malley, Maryland Governor and former Mayor of Baltimore; Joe Biden, current Vice President and perpetual comic relief; Andrew Cuomo was former New York Attorney General and U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under the Clinton administration is the eldest son of the legendary ex-Governor of New York and Democratic Party heavyweight, Mario Cuomo; Howard Dean as long as he remains calm and not scream eerily; Rahm Emanuel was part of the power behind President Obama\u2019s first term; and Al Franken who is a humorous joke which would make a mockery of the office and a few others. There are a few who are above the fold candidates who have the backing of some of the Democrat elite and thus will be the ones who will be the top contenders. Hillary Clinton is the most obvious with Elizabeth Warren the favorite of the leadership of the not Hillary establishment and lastly there is Michelle Obama who would have a formidable cash producing"
"Unlike the blue jays\u2019 flimsy nests, those of the gray jay are bulky, deep and well insulated. They are lined with feathers and even bits of fur. The three or four nestlings are fed food that the parents cached the previous year. By nesting early, the young get a head start on amassing the food stores they will need to get through their first winter.\nJuvenile gray jays are a sooty grey all over and almost look like they belong to a different species. In June, they begin a serious struggle for dominance. The young jays chase each other more and more aggressively until one of them will have expelled its siblings from the parents\u2019 territory. This more dominant bird will continue to live with its parents for two or three years, or until a nearby territory becomes available. This is why you often see gray jays in groups of three. Sometimes, however, the third bird is an \u201cejectee\u201d from another territory that is now living with unrelated adults. The weaker siblings are forced to leave the territory and most will die before winter arrives. This strange behaviour on the part of young jays makes evolutionary sense. They are probably not skilled enough to store sufficient food for their first-winter needs and have to rely on help from adult birds. It is unlikely, however, that there would be sufficient food for a second or third juvenile, hence the fight for dominance.\nGray jays are found from coast to coast in Canada and in all of our provinces and territories. In Ontario, their range extends from the edge of the tree line in the north to the last isolated spruce bogs where the Canadian Shield meets the Great Lakes \u2013 St. Lawrence Lowlands in the \u201cLand Between\u201d.\nHowever, you won\u2019t find gray jays in our towns and cities. This might make you wonder why we would want a national bird that so few of us can easily observe first-hand? David Bird, Emeritus Professor of Ornithology at McGill University, argues that this very fact might motivate more Canadians to visit the northern forests to see their national bird and learn more about its increasingly threatened habitat.\nGray jays can still be found in the northern Kawarthas, although their numbers are decreasing. Up until about 15 years ago, at least one pair had a"

But as Perry also notes, Henry, Smith, and Agholor all provide run-after-catch abilities no one on the roster possessed in 2020.\nAs such, it seems New England hopes that sticking to a physical, downhill running game while getting better, if not necessarily much faster, at its skill positions can be enough to turn the offense around in 2021.\nStay up to date on all the latest news from Boston.com\nThis discussion has ended.

In a classic Rushdie move, it then becomes apparent that he\u2019s not the main character at all. That said, in being completely without Shame, he\u2019s definitely a part of the title.\nThe story takes us next to Delhi, where Bilquis, the future wife of General Raza Hyder, future President of Pakistan, is fleeing a communal riot in the heart of Delhi, and how she takes refuge in the Red Fort and meets her husband there, the man who cried too easily, who would emigrate to Karachi with her."

"Greek and Roman texts relevant to homosexuality in a single volume. I doubt that it\u2019s exhaustive, especially with regard to male homosexuality, but Hubbard seems to have made special efforts to include female-oriented material. The material is organized chronologically and by literary genre, with an introductory discussion in each section to provide historic context.\nLHMP #216 Adams 1982 The Latin Sexual Vocabulary\nThe general scope of the work is language used to describe or refer to sexual and excretory acts, either as the primary meaning of the words, as a standard euphemism, or as ad hoc metaphorical or poetic reference. From the context of usage, especially the nature and formality of the text, one can identify hierarchies of offensiveness.\nLHMP #202 Donoghue 1993 Imagined More than Women: Lesbians as Hermaphrodites\nThe general topic of this article is the ways in which women who had sex with women in 17-18th century Britain were marginalized from the category of \u201cwomen\u201d via the imagined figure of the hermaphrodite, combining in the image of the tribade who was endowed with a penis-equivalent, either in the form of an enlarged clitoris or sometimes a prolapsed vagina capable of performing penetration. This article traces that image through various genres of literature, both popular and professional.\nLHMP #189 Trumbach 1991 London\u2019s Sapphists: From Three Sexes to Four Genders in the Making of Modern Culture\n[Note: I\u2019d like to remind readers of my convention that my commentary and critique of articles is typically enclosed in square brackets, unless it\u2019s clear enough from context that I\u2019m speaking in my own voice.

Change Your Society. Close\nYes. I live with dementia. Let me help you understand: Jane Kennedy\nJane Kennedy lives in Newmarket, Ontario, where she works as a teacher. She is also a caregiver to her mom, Eileen, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease in 2016.\nMy mom was officially diagnosed at age 84. However, there were signs already of dementia for some time. The diagnosis didn\u2019t come as a complete surprise because my grandmother had it and I was already seeing some early signs with my mom. I would say though that I also experienced some denial around the signs she was displaying.\nLearning to live with dementia\nThroughout these years, I\u2019ve noticed how my mom was always there to take care of the most precious gift she has\u2014her family. She took care of both her father and her husband, who both had cancer. She took care of her mom, who had Alzheimer\u2019s. She\u2019s been the caregiver to so many people while being a cancer survivor herself.\nWatching my mom in action, taking care of the people closest to her, I could do nothing but admire her strength. And she did it with such patience, love and understanding, too.\nNow that my mom has been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, it\u2019s time for my brother and I to take care of her.

"calculated at 94.64%. And you can be sure that no cheats are allowed.\nThe jackpot of the game is scored by obtaining five orange or blue 7 symbols made with the maximum bet. In other words, players can win a grand total of 50,000.00NZD . Even so, there are other opportunities to increase the number of winnings won without having to score the highest paid combination.\nThe key tips for scoring the biggest rewards in the gambling machine are through its Free Bonus Feature. This can only be activated when the player lands at least two or more of the Scatter, represented by the Devil\u2019s trident, on the leftmost reels. The more Scatters the player lands on the reels, the more extra games they will receive. It is during these rounds that all winning combinations are doubled until the extra games end. It is important to note that the jackpot and Wild symbols will have no effect during these special rounds.\nIf the player scores two Scatters, he/she wins a total of 5 free spins;\nThree of a kind wins a total of 10 free spins;\nFour of a kind wins a total of 20 free spins;\nFive Scatters altogether can win the player a huge total of 50 free spins.\nWhen used in betting strategies, applying the bonus rounds can be the best way to maximise the winnings instead of directly aiming towards the jackpot. For example, when winning the prizes from the coin symbol, where five rewards 300, this can be brought up to 600. Even the Wilds with their max prize of 5,000 can be brought up to 10,000 when won during a free spin. This can win the player 10,000.00NZD .\nSo Hot casino players will have an enjoyable and rewarding experience even if the features themselves are relatively simple. The graphics themselves are also rather humble, but this just makes the fire-styled art pop out even more. So Hot is designed towards those who don\u2019t want complex rules to spoil having good-old fashioned fun with gambling. Even so, there is still room for some customisation with the different amount"
"\nOur campus, voted 1 of 20 most beautiful in the nation, is home to a small forest of 1,511 trees. The largest tree on campus is our iconic giant sequoia right outside the Wheelock Student Center. On a clear day, you can see Mount Rainier from the center of campus. It's true that the Pacific Northwest is home to stunning mountain ranges, lush forests, cool waters, and endless hiking trails, but it's also a community of thoughtful and empathetic individuals. It's the perfect place to grow, explore, and connect with others.\nCampus Facilities & Equipment\nOur Collins Memorial Library is a treasure trove of resources, from the expected (individual and group study spaces, an excellent collection of print volumes and magazines, and an online database) to the convenient (technology and media services, computer support, and equipment rental). But perhaps the most special resource at Collins Memorial Library is the Makerspace where students have access to 3\u2014D printers, laser cutters, sewing machines, art supplies, and a number of creative workshops. In 2016, Puget Sound renovated and expanded our Athletic & Aquatics center.\nOff-Campus Opportunities\nAs a college town, Tacoma is unmatched; explore the outdoors from the boardwalk, beach access, and the sprawling Point Defiance urban park, then enjoy the city with its incredible food scene, hidden gems for vintage shoppers, and the museum district with 6 different museums.

"California Chamber of Commerce board to threaten both labor unrest from his allies and direct regulatory action from his office.\u201d\nBounds offered no individual names and campaign spokeswoman Sarah Pompei could not either. But their pal and fellow Republican partisan Chip Hanlon, over at Red County, said Brown had threatened labor unrest and other investigations in conversations with executives from Safeway and the Bank of America.\nIf true, of course, this would represent a serious misuse of power by the Attorney General of California. But according to Brown\u2019s spokesman Sterling Clifford, who said he was within earshot of all the calls the Browns made to Chamber board members, \u201cIt is frankly and flatly false. It\u2019s a face-saving, desperate statement of a campaign whose allies attempted to circumvent campaign finance law and were uncovered.\u201d\nIf we hear from some Chamber members that Brown was stupid enough to threaten them, we\u2019ll be among the first to call for him to be held to account. In the meantime, here\u2019s what\u2019s bothering at us about all this: something\u2019s fishy over at the Cal Chamber.\nWhy hide who the donors are who financed the ad? That\u2019s what Zaremberg did by having the Chamber produce and place the ad instead of running the operation through the Chamber\u2019s Political Action Committee, which would have to disclose the donors.\nThe Chamber can argue that\u2019s because this was an \u201cissue ad\u201d \u2014 not a political ad \u2014 which may be legally true but practically specious. Even if it was legally an issue ad because it never called for viewers to vote for or against anyone, this was an attack ad \u2014 pure and simple.\nWhy was the ad \u2014 which decries job losses in California \u2014 produced at Interface Media Group in Washington, DC, and why was it placed by Mentzer Media of Townsend, MD? Who made the ad? Who financed it? Did anyone at the Chamber get a commission or a fee?\nCan someone explain this transaction?

Building on traditional Qatari hospitality Priestmangoode has developed the design of the on-board lounge to be an extension of the airline\u2019s airport lounge. The overall aim of the design was to generate the feeling of a integrated VIP corporate jet. The lounge offers cream leather sofa seating for six passengers and standing room at the bar. There is also a small mini-bar with spotlight mood lighting, and some space for magazines to be placed. In the 2009 and 2010 Skytrax Awards, Qatar Airways Economy Class was named best in the world.\nQatar Airways have 42 Business Class flatbed seats on their Airbus A340-642 aircraft with a 2-2-2 configuration. Each seat has a generous pitch of a 78 inch recline and is 22 inches wide. Generous legroom allows you to stretch comfortably and the built-in massager helps you relax. This is far better than most other airlines around the world. All the seats have a huge 15.6-inch PTV display screen, in-seat reading light, in-seat drinks holders, and in-seat power units.\nIn Business Class, the toilets are equipped with refreshing towels (various coloured packaging), eau de toilette, moisture cream, and a hand cream (all by Molton Brown).

"and the decade of the 2010's. Really, the past 10 years haven't been great for collectors of vintage Joes. It started off strongly as vintage pricing was way down, availability was way up and factory custom makers were starting to come online with their wares. But, that was really the high point. While we've seen great factory customs come to dominate the vintage Joe space, we've also a radical uptick in vintage pricing that's making the hobby much less fun since figures are now seen as valued commodities instead of the toys they are. All that being said, though, I still have time to fit in a final profile of the year. There's a well known strategy where you dump unpopular items at an unpopular time so that you don't waste the more valuable slots with content that isn't likely to generate any interest. With that in mind, I present the 1988 Windmill.\nWindmill has only been a part of my collection due to Funskool's take on the mold. With that figure in hand, there is simply no reason to look elsewhere for the character. But, the Indian figure exists because Hasbro sculpted this figure in the late 1980's and tossed him into a vehicle. Windmill is a far cry from the days of Crankcase, Heavy Metal, or even Backstop. He's not the worst figure in the line. But, he's in the discussion. The figure's colors, design and overall sculpting show a slippage in the quality Joe aficionados had come to expect. In reality, Windmill was nothing more than another example of the diminished paint applications that were the hallmark of the entire 1988 series. But, to a collector who only discovered him as an adult, Windmill has an insurmountable amount of detriments in his way to ever gaining appreciation.\nI'm not real sure what happened with the 1988 vehicle drivers...at least on the Joe side. The Cobras are passable and not really any worse than other years. But, the Joes really took a turn for the worse. Skidmark and Windmill introduce bright green and orange to the pantheon"

The libraries of Wayne County strive to support students in the three local school districts, as well as homeschooled students, to ensure they get the help they need to improve their grades, increase their confidence, and encourage them to expand their educational explorations.\nThis donation, which was made through the Educational Improvement Tax Credit (EITC) Program, will provide funds for several programs such as Learning@theLibrary and Teen Tech@theLibrary. Both include the purchase of Tutor.com, Teen Health and Wellness, Learning Express Library, Core Concepts (Biology, Chemistry, Periodic Table), PowerKnowledge (Earth/Space, Physical, & Life Science), and Prenda Coding.\nIn addition, some of the funding is allocated for after school Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematic, and Arts programs. Along with holding enriching programs within the walls of the library, Outreach Coordinator, Jessica Kjera, heads out into the schools and the community. She teaches STEAM programs and familiarizes students/families with the awesome selection of E-resources, fun, and learning they have access to with their library card. Jessica has recently transitioned into the roll with the assistance of retiring long time outreach coordinator, Mary Fritz. Another portion of the funding supports AWE computers for K-2nd grade students and hybridization of library programs which allow libraries to do virtual as well as in person programs.\nWCPL Director Tracy L. Schwarz said, \u201cThe resources provided by The Dime Bank kept families connected during the Covid shutdown and beyond. The funding helped keep Tutor.com and other STEAM related online resources running for families who were forced to teach their school aged students at home. It also provided a set of laptops, microphones, lighting, speakers, and all the items required for each of the seven libraries to go virtual with programs as needed.

"have to think of an interface that is digestible. And, since a 3D representation on a 2D screen can be confusing, it means the core of the interface should be in 2D. This affects the design, which also starts with a 2D existence. We played with a dotted line, which is a very common 2D representation. Using Illustrator, we applied the same thickness, but modifying the gaps to achieve a specific tone or a unique rhythm in a dotted line. This was then transformed into press fit connections in 3D. The process went back and forth, like a ping-pong game between 2D and 3D in the design, interface, detailing, decoration, manufacturing and assembly. The ping-ponging gave it a specific character. It created a certain visual language that is recognizable. Whatever you do with Box-o-rama it will always be Box-o-rama.\nHV: The interesting part of dealing with digital media is that they have their own limits. They give input into how they would structure the design, which is interesting for developing new products. The biggest and most difficult aspect is that there\u2019s no sense of touch involved. You get into this virtual world and there are only fragments of the real thing. We love the gravity tool, which comes into play in Box-o-rama when customers put boxes on top of each other. Gravity is introduced in a digital sense and it\u2019s one of the first steps for getting a feeling for the object. The other interesting thing is that the tool makes decisions of its own, making some options impossible. It ensures that one cannot order something that cannot exist.\nHow do you feel about opening up design to customers?\nHV: We treated the assignment as a way to communicate not only the possibility for a consumer to be able to transform the design and to make his own stuff, but also to communicate about our office and our attitude towards open design. This system is not star designer based. Making a framework instead of defined and finished products is where I see the difference between star design and non-star design.\nHow do you think people will react?\nHV: Knowledge is still transported through humans, institutes, or some other kind of \u201creal world\u201d channel.

"ile Mind. Ethic. Nicom. Lib. IV. Cap. XI. Hence it appears that Aristotle considers the Disposition of all those in general, who command their Passion, when they have just Reason to be angry, as a Vice opposite to Lenity by Defect; and that he does not, as Gronovius pretends, confine that Censure to the stupid and mean Patience of Buffoons and Parasites, who tamely submit to the greatest Affronts and Indignities, in Consideration of some paultry Advantage. But if we consider the Matter in itself, the Tranquillity of a Mind, free from Anger, is not a moral Defect. For supposing, what is very seldom to be found, a Man either naturally or by the Force of long Custom so hard to be moved, that he is seldom or never angry, he is thus very happy, as being secured from the Excesses of a blind Passion; nor will such a Man be less disposed, or less able to maintain his just Rights, and that of his Friends. On the contrary, by being Master of his Passions, and of a peaceable Disposition, he will be able to take more just Measures, and manage his Interest better than those, who are actuated by a Passion so hard to govern as Anger. Though Anger is not evil in its own Nature, and may be allowed to a certain Point, it is never absolutely necessary. We always may, and that with more Security, support our Dignity and maintain our Right, without being in a Passion. But it is evident that our Philosopher makes a Virtue of a moderate Degree of Anger, and a Desire of Revenge, the natural Effect of that Passion; which being in itself vitious, never allows Anger to be kept within due Bounds.\n[1 ] He speaks in the following Manner of Justice, properly so called, which he terms particular or private, to distinguish it from universal or general Justice, including the Practice of all the Virtues which relate to our Neighbour. This Distinction being made, it is evident that a just Action consists in observing a Medium between doing an Injury and receiving one. He that does an Injury, has more, and he who is injured, less"

I\u2019d discussed taking a friend up for a trip some months back, and we had settled on a date \u2013 today was to be the day. Dave asked if his 14 year old daughter could come along too \u2013 perhaps she had been persuaded by my own family that it was fun.\nI\u2019d been looking closely at the weather and had seen a band of rain move across from the West overnight, with a further heavier band due to arrive on Sunday evening.

"ten according to the undertaking of man, in which through the adoption of grace he deigned to have brothers, for whom he should be the First-Begotten.'[lix] And after some words he says: 'After the fullness of time came, he accepted the form of the servant for our salvation and he became the Son of Man. Hence certain things follow about him in the scriptures regarding the form of God, and certain things regarding the form of the servant, of which for the sake of example two certain things are mentioned, in order that each may be referred to its own. According to the form of God he said about himself: 'I and the Father are One.' According to the form of the servant: 'The Father is greater than I.' But men understanding less what is said for what, want to transfer to the form of God those things that have been said according to the form of the servant, and also those things that have been said so that the persons should be related to each other, they want to be the names of nature and substance, and they make an error in faith. But thus has the human nature been joined to the Son of God, so that from the two substances there should arise the one person. Therefore man alone bore the cross, but on account of the unity of the person God is also said to have borne it. From there is that which is written: 'For if they had known, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.'[lx] Therefore we say the Son of God was crucified, not from the virtue of divinity, but from the infirmity of humanity, not from the endurance of his nature, but from our undertaking.'[lxi] For also the prophet says: 'Have mercy, oh Lord, on Your people, over whom Your name has been invoked, and Israel, whom You have equated with Your First-Begotten.'[lxii] This equality is not in the divinity, but in the humanity alone and in the adoption of the flesh, which he received from the virgin. The one and same God and Man in two natures and one person bore the end of death with divinity intact. He says according to his deity: 'I have the power to put aside the soul and I have the power to take it up again.'[lxiii] He says according to his human"
"\u2019s coming out with the people in the room stronger than he was going in.\u201d\nBut Decatur resident Beth Long, who has been to five meetings and held up the handmade sign Tuesday, said May has given inconsistent answers to some questions.\n\u201cHe comes across to me like a car salesman,\u201d she said.\nAnother big error the AJC found in the investigators\u2019 report concerned an allegation that Commissioner Stan Watson spent more than $90,000 on printing and mailing in 2008 and 2009. Watson wasn\u2019t even in office then \u2014 the money was actually spent by his predecessor, Connie Stokes.\nIn other instances, the authors got the substance right, but were sloppy in laying out details.\nThe Sanitation department did not hire back an employee arrested for driving drunk in a county vehicle the week after he resigned. The trash collector actually got his job back about six months later \u2014 which is laid out in the investigators\u2019 own notes, obtained by the AJC through an open records request.\nAnd the county was not wrapped up in a money-wasting $2.4 million contract with T-Mobile Communications. The company, out of Tucker, is called Mobile Communications, which was also reflected accurately in the investigators\u2019 notes.\nA disputed hotel bill\nPerhaps the most sensational allegation in the investigators' report \u2014 under the heading \"Specific Improper Spending\" \u2014 was May's \"purchase of a movie ($36.45) and a spa treatment ($222.71) during his December 2014 stay at the Grand Wailea Waldorf Astoria Hotel and Spa in Hawaii,\" while on official business at a National Association of Counties meeting.\nThe report says May claimed he reimbursed the county for those charges, but never produced proof. But the AJC found no record of county money ever paying for those expenses, meaning there was nothing for May to pay back.\nThe bill for four nights totaled $1,536. It shows a $565 deposit paid in November with a Visa card that the AJC confirmed was May\u2019s county P-card. Hotel manager Cynthia Rada said that sum covered two nights"
"and consider the bigger picture, you can pinpoint a portrait of what Americans are wrestling with today. Look even deeper and find bigger questions being asked every time books are challenged.\nShould books with religious viewpoints be allowed in schools (and is it a religious viewpoint not to have them)? Do parents have the right of oversight by minimizing the accessibility of some books? Is there an appropriate age limit for certain content (and if so, then who decides)? Are depictions of racism part of the problem or part of the solution?\nDoes expressing sexuality breed tolerance or temptation? Should booksellers be forced to sell all books or only those they agree with and support? Are history books beginning to exploit the power of complaint and using emotional bribery to invent ever increasing levels of social guilt? And what about those other books \u2014 the ones specifically written to incite, recruit, or defame?\nThese questions aren't always as easy for everyone as people tend to rally to protect their own beliefs and convictions but generally struggle to protect those they consider in opposition to their own. How about you? Is there a line you won't cross in defense against censorship? Maybe there are many lines.\nReadmore View Comments\nExploring Imagination: The Creativity Equation<s> SING 2015\nAshley Zhao and Rodela Ahmed|December 24, 2015\nPhoto by Faheema Syahbal\nAfter the Freshiors became the winners of SING! for the first time in years, there was a great deal of elation, shock, and grief.

I hunched up the muscle and took the chop. It was good but it was a welterweight chop. He was out of his division.\nI pushed out a slow right-hand punch that missed his head by a foot. He pounced on the arm, turned his hip into me, and tried to throw me. I didn\u2019t let him. I kept the arm bent so he couldn\u2019t work against my elbow and braced my front leg so he couldn\u2019t pivot me over his hip. He heaved into his throw and nothing happened. We stood in strained counterpoise for a minute. Then, with my left hand, I took a good hold on his belt at the small of his back and lifted his feet off the ground. At the same time I forced my right arm back in against his neck until I could get a grip on his shirt front. He tried to spin loose, but with his feet off the ground he didn\u2019t have a lot of traction. I shifted my feet, arched my back a bit, took a deep breath, and jerked him up over my head, holding him horizontal to the floor. The ceiling in the living room was just high enough.\n\u201cMick,\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice easy, as if there was no strain to it, \u201ceither we agree to be pals, or I fire you through that window.\u201d\nI don\u2019t think I pulled off the no strain part. \u201cQuick,\u201d I said. My arms felt a little trembly. He wasn\u2019t as heavy as a barbell, but he wasn\u2019t as nicely balanced either.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said.\nI set him down on his feet. He was very flushed, and his breathing was quick and short. He stared at me without any sound but the quick breathing. His eyes were very wide. His nostrils seemed flared and pale. One eyelid trembled.\nI waited.\nThe breathing eased slightly, and he nodded his head, the nods getting smaller and smaller. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYe"

"directly represent shareholder interests because board members own only 1.2% of the Company's shares, compared with the 9.1% stake of Loeb and its affiliates. While the percentages quoted are accurate, Loeb failed to mention one important fact:\nA comparison of ownership levels is surely more relevant when viewed on a relative, and not nominal, basis. We estimate that Loeb, an US$800 million hedge fund, has approximately 5% of its portfolio invested in MOSAID shares. In contrast, key executives and board members of MOSAID have invested a considerably greater portion of their personal net worth in the Company: Mr. Cwynar owns 35,974 shares; Mr. Boadway owns 40,000 shares; Mr. Csathy, Chairman of the Board, owns 60,860 shares; and Mr. Glenn Evans, Senior Vice President and General Manager of MOSAID's Systems Division, owns 21,233 shares.\nAccording to Loeb's circular, their nominees to the MOSAID board do not own any MOSAID shares.\nLOEB WANTS SHAREHOLDERS TO PAY FOR THEIR ATTACK ON MOSAID\nIn their proxy circular, Loeb refers to an August 21, 2006 proposed settlement agreement. Loeb's proposal to MOSAID contained a long list of demands, including that two Loeb nominees be put forward for election and that, once elected, these two directors be effectively put in charge of developing strategic alternatives for the Company. We rejected this circumvention of the orderly nomination process established within our corporate governance practices, which are consistent with the guidelines of the Canadian Securities Administrators and all reputable publicly traded companies. We also refused to abdicate the board's responsibility to provide stewardship for the Company, including strategic directions, in favour of Loeb's short-term goal of selling MOSAID.\nWhat Loeb did not tell shareholders is that they also proposed that the Company pay all of their expenses associated with their attack on MOSAID.

"Palpatine appears before the Galactic Senate, still wearing his black cloak shrouding his face, making all the representatives fear they're being invaded by the Sith Lord, before removing it and setting everyone at ease (and going back and forth for good measure!). The Lego instruction manuals are a nice sight gag, while Jabba the Hutt's floating subtitles are a very subversive little joke most will miss. Heck, even Darth Maul gets lampooned in a background joke that is beyond fitting and cold blooded!\nThe story alternates between the younglings with their droid guides and young Han Solo and Yoda, spending an equal amount of time making each subplot work effectively, and the time flies right on by, weaving hilarious joke after hilarious joke, without a single bomb or unfunny moment. This cartoon does ignore every sense of the word continuity, but by aiming wider, at the entire saga, there are many more effective moments, including a few non-'Star Wars' gags that work quite well. 'The Padawan Menace' is filled with familiar characters (some depicted in a funny manner, like the long necked Yarael Poof), memorable settings, and limitless replay value. From opening scroll to Admiral Ackbar ending, it's clear that all those involved in this little story have a fond place in their heart for 'Star Wars,' and it's a real treat to experience their silly little creation.\nThe Disc: Vital Stats\n'Lego Star Wars: The Padawan Menace' arrives day and date with 'Star Wars' on Blu-ray, exclusively sold at Wal-Mart (for $13.00) stores for an undisclosed time period.

"WA. And no, I didn't have a release form. My feeling is that things have been changing so rapidly with electronic publishing and the fact that titles need to go up quickly so as not to lose sales that many print publishers haven't geared up for this. Now, when all the print magazines also go electronic and stay up forever, we may have a problem. The anthologies should have some provision to release rights.

My question was--what do you think of requiring release form WITH submission and BEFORE acceptance?\nI don't see that happening. As I said, print editions don't release rights until the books are out of print.\nI've never encountered that, except for maybe a contest. My best advice is to review the contract--if it has no termination date, no right reversion, I'd walk away.\nHere's what our release looks like. It does say 15 months, not a year.

". You have to charge the unit for at least 8 hours which is done through a standard USB charger. Then, to start using it, you turn it on by opening the cover, sliding a switch across and pressing a button.\nYou can then install the tracker in your vehicle, download the app and keep track of where your car is at any time. It\u2019s really super simple and, after the initial charge, it takes you just minutes to be ready to go.\nInstalling the GPS Tracker\nWe found that simply putting the tracker into the car boot worked for us. It\u2019s black colouring allows it to blend into the boot without screaming that there\u2019s a tracker installed plus, it comes with another magnet so we were able to use that to secure it to one of the unused seatbelts in the boot of the car.\nThe unit is only 6.1cm x 3.5cm x 10.9 cm and weighs just over 300g so it could be placed in a glove compartment, under a seat or in any recess in a vehicle. It\u2019s really noninvasive and discreet.\nHow does the tracker work?\nAs the name suggests, the PAJ GPS POWER Finder 4G uses an M2M SIM card to allow connectivity to local 4G networks all over the world, so you will always know where it is, even if there isn\u2019t any GPS signal being received. This requires a small extra monthly subscription.\nWith a 10,000 mAh Lithium-Polymer rechargeable battery the PAJ GPS POWER Finder 4G has around 40 days of battery-life for constant tracking or approximately 90 days of battery life in standby mode.\nThe PAJ GPS POWER Finder 4G is used alongside the PAJ Finder app which is available on the App Store and Google Play but you can always just use the website if you want to.\nAs you would expect, there is a live tracking function available so you can instantly see where your vehicle is. This updates every 30 seconds unless the tracker changes direction in which case it updates immediately.\nYou can also set up a geofence zone, where the tracker won\u2019t send alerts to your app"

Those in the industry say many of the licensed prostitutes, who work as independent contractors, have struggled to qualify for unemployment benefits since closures began last March and some have opted to take their work into the shadows, offering sex illegally.\nWhile the business of legal bordellos may seem incompatible with social distancing, sex workers and brothel owners say that\u2019s not the case. Like other close-contact industries such as massage therapy and dental services, they contend brothels should be allowed to reopen with protective measures.\n\u201cWe could easily do work at arm\u2019s length, just the same as they do within the massage parlors, which are open in the state of Nevada,\u201d sex worker Alice Little said. \u201cYou can go to a dentist and have him put his hands in your mouth. You can go to a tattoo parlor and get your face tattooed right now. You can get piercings put in your face. You\u2019re certainly not masked for any of those things.\u201d\nSo far, Nevada officials haven\u2019t agreed.\nA state task force that makes recommend"

OK, they're being manipulated, but it's nothing that doesn't happen daily in military recruiting offices. Everybody's gonna be the pilot and nobody's gonna be any of the hundreds of people who maintain each aircraft or thousands of people who feed and coddle the pilots or the top guns who clean the latrines - (or the recruiters who have to lie every day of their lives).\nDoug Holland December 9, 2022 at 5:11\u202fPM\nYup, it's all part of the bullshit flood. That's what the military does, what recruitment is. The movies drive up enlistment, else the military wouldn't be a sponsor, which makes Tom Cruise and Top Gun minor co-sponsors of all the bullshit US wars and related deaths since 1986.\nMan, my ankle is killing me.

However, when it was discovered that the state of the existing dwelling rendered this impossible, demolition and reconstruction became the point of departure for a new project.

"even the occasional \u201cYahoo!\u201d Where once stood stone-faced number crunchers, big kids now gleefully put the pedal to the metal.\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what Beneteau planners had in mind when they conceived the First 40. But they wanted to include the family, too, so they approached the team at Farr Yacht Design with a broad brief: Keep or even improve the performance of the highly successful First 40.7, but include all the requisite elements of a family-friendly cruiser, including lounging spaces in the cockpit, a well-appointed interior, and viable systems for extended coastal voyages.\nFarr\u2019s designers achieved this through clever convertibility, most obviously seen is the removable cockpit seats/stowage lockers. For the Wednesday-night races, these are left at the dock, opening up a no-frills cockpit with ample room for a full racing crew. Once reattached, the lockers are long enough to be comfortable seats and large enough to hold all the toys and tools central to an extended family cruise. Likewise, the helm seat, which runs gunwale to gunwale across the open transom, acts as a secure enclosure when cruising, but on race nights, this, too, stays behind to create more space and easy access to the backstay adjuster.\nA double-ended mainsheet system operates off a wide athwartship traveler forward of the helm. The towering triple-spreader aluminum rig holds a generous 1,055 square feet of working sail. A ballast-to-displacement ratio of .42, with the ballast residing mostly in the 8-foot-deep lead bulb, ensures that the boat stands up to this sail plan. Both the D/L ratio of 166 and the SA/D ratio (100%) of 21.5 validate Beneteau\u2019s prediction of up to a 15-second-per-mile improvement over the already fast First 40.7. And if that\u2019s not fast enough, an optional turbocharge package that includes a carbon-fiber mast and rod rigging is also available.\nAfter my firm hip check removed a fellow"

"02 AU. A crucial underlying assumption, however, is that the mediating scalar field has negligible self-interactions. As argued in gubserkhoury , the addition of a quartic term drastically changes the picture. Gravitational-strength coupling to matter is allowed again, even with a quartic coupling as small as \u223c10\u221253 nelson . The ability for self-interacting scalars to hide from experiments relies on the chameleon mechanism original ; gubserkhoury , which suppresses fifth-force signals in two ways.\nFigure 1: Current experimental constraints on the strength \u03b1 and range L (in meters) of a Yukawa fifth force, ignoring self-interactions. Reprinted from adellong .\nFirstly, the presence of ambient matter density generates a tadpole term in the Klein-Gordon equation, which shifts the minimum of the potential. Because of the quartic coupling, the mass of small fluctuations around this effective minimum can be much larger than the mass in vacuum. This is most emphatically illustrated with a massless field with quartic coupling of order unity: in a medium of density 1 g/cm3, the effective mass is 0.1 mm.\nSecondly, the fifth force is further suppressed by the thin shell effect, another startling consequence of the nonlinearity of the field equations. Within a dense macroscopic body, the effective mass of the scalar is large. As a result, the contribution of the core to the external field is exponentially small. Only a thin shell near the surface exerts a significant pull on an exterior test particle. In fact, for an infinite plate, the force at the surface eventually saturates as the thickness is increased, causing the strength relative to gravity to fall off rapidly.\nIt follows that an ideal experiment to detect a chameleon-like scalar must: 1. use sufficiently small test masses to minimize the thin shell suppression; and 2. probe the force at distances mm to avoid the exponential damping from the effective mass. These considerations point towards the E\u00f6t-Wash experiment at the University of Washington hoyle .\nIn this paper we carefully assess the ability of the E\u00f6t-Wash experiment to detect or exclude chameleon scalar fields with quartic self-interactions."
"by davidrcurry\nWASHINGTON, March 7, 2022 \u2014\nThe heads of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank Group, World Health Organization, and World Trade Organization held high-level consultations with UNICEF, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Lead Coordinator for the COVID-19 Vaccine Country Readiness and Delivery and the CEOs of leading vaccine manufacturers on 1 March 2022 aimed at ensuring the rapid delivery of vaccines to where they are needed the most and putting those vaccines into arms.\nThe Multilateral Leaders Task Force issued the following statement:\n\u201cIn the past few months, we have seen unprecedented levels of disease transmission across the world due to the Omicron variant. Still, unequal access to COVID-19 vaccines, tests and treatments is rampant, prolonging the pandemic. 23 countries are yet to fully vaccinate 10% of their populations, 73 countries are yet to achieve 40% coverage and many more are projected to miss the 70% target by middle of this year.\nThe biggest challenges are in low-income countries (LICs), which are concentrated in Africa. Only 7% of people in LICs have been fully vaccinated, compared with 73% in high-income countries. Safeguarding the health of people living in the world\u2019s poorest countries in the face of a changing pandemic is a key priority. We must and can ensure that these countries have the access, the means, and the capacity to vaccinate their populations, especially those who are most at risk.\nDespite the challenges, there has been progress. The vaccine supply constraints from last year have eased, and export restrictions are not currently an issue. Our efforts must now focus on supporting countries to increase vaccination rates. There is no \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach as each country faces different political, administrative, and capacity challenges.\nInsufficient health care infrastructure, including warehouses, cold chain capacity; lack of trained vaccinators; complexities associated with the management of multiple vaccines; lack of data systems to support vaccination campaigns; and mis"

His most \"impressive statistics\" are wins (ie, having good teammates) and innings pitched (which blew out his arm, as MIR says). I think he got extra credit for the pennants and the sexy nicknames. And it's cute how you use high Cy Young finishes as relevant to Hunter, not relevant for Blyleven.

"2, Grayson Hall, Jennifer Salt, Jim Hutton, John Newland, Kim Darby, MonsterZero NJ, Nigel McKeand, Patty Maloney, Robert Prince, Scott Glenn, Stan Winston, Steven Karpf, Tamara De Treaux, William Demarest, Woody Chamblis | 6 Comments\nThe 70s was a great time for made for TV horror. So, for this week\u2019s Saturday Night Double Feature I have decided to showcase two 70s TV movie horrors that scared the heck out of me when I was a little kid and watched them when they first aired. Gargoyles and the original Don\u2019t Be Afraid Of The Dark gave me nightmares back in the day, when I was a lad of less then ten years old and will always remain horror favorites despite what effect time might have had on them\u2026and speaking of which, what effect did they still have on me?\u2026\nGARGOYLES (1972)\nGargoyles is still one of my favorites and brings back such memories of a seven year old MonsterZero NJ being scared out of his wits by this fun and sometimes still spooky TV movie. The film opens with narration telling us that when The Devil was cast from Heaven he vowed to get revenge by ruling earth and every 600 years his minions, The Gargoyles would rise up to attempt to do so. We then focus on Dr. Mercer Boley (Cornel Wilde), a scientist and author who specializes in the study of man\u2019s belief in demons, traveling in the desert with his hot photographer daughter Diana (Jennifer Salt) to see a man who claims to have found something of interest. Uncle Willie (Woody Chamblis) is an old man running a middle of nowhere roadside attraction and shows the pair a bizarre skeleton that looks like some kind of man-sized flying, horned lizard. Boley thinks it a fraud, but agrees to hear the old man\u2019s tale of the local Native American legends telling of the tribes battling such creatures. During his tale the shack is attacked and Mercer and Diana barely escape with their lives and the mysterious creature\u2019s skull,"
"recent watch and jewelry trade shows in Las Vegas. They didn\u2019t need to ask me twice. Below are my impressions from a week in Sin City with the watch.\nThe watch makes an immediate impression with its famous octagonal case \u2014 another contribution to watch design history by the legendary G\u00e9rald Genta, whose other horological brainchildren include the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak and Patek Philippe Nautilus. The combo of shiny black and matte black with polished rose gold and brushed rose gold is appealing as one might expect. The multi-layered Octo case catches the eye with its brushed-finish round bezel layered over the octagonal, polished-finish base.\nThe multifaceted, multilevel case is all sharp angles and smooth, straight edges and yet is extremely comfortable on the wrist and also not excessively large or heavy, though not every wearer might agree with me here. I can report that the watch, at about 13 mm in thickness, did not have a problem staying discreetly tucked under any of my dress shirt cuffs, not that I was all that concerned with hiding it from admiring eyes. The polished black dot inset into the rose-gold screw-down crown was a nice touch; even nicer was the use of gold screws to anchor the black DLC caseback around the see-through window.\nIt\u2019s best if you\u2019re not overly concerned with the date, as it is tucked away, quite unobtrusively, between the 4 and 5 o\u2019clock indices and can be easily overlooked but not so easily discerned in low lighting. The white type on black background makes the small date numeral blend seamlessly with the rest of the dial, but here\u2019s a case where the design blasphemy of a less elegant, black-numerals-on-white-background date window may have improved legibility. (One stops worrying about the day and date quite easily while running around to and from events and appointments in Las Vegas, so this was not, frankly, something, that caused me much concern during my review period.)\nFor those uninitiated in the corporate hierarchies of watch brands, Bulgari shares corporate"

", and they shall investigate accordingly.\nPlacenta Consumption or Cannibalism?\nPlacenta consumption is a rare practice in modern times. Most of the animal kingdom practice placentophagy, which is the act of the mother eating the placenta after birth. Such practice by humans is limited to homeopathic birth coaches who believe it wards off post-partum depression. The placenta is gathered, dried, then encapsulated and consumed in capsule form.\nSeveral celebrities seem to have picked up the cause. Tom Cruise joked about doing so before Katie Holmes gave birth to Siri. January Jones admitted doing so in January 2012. However, public reaction is universally negative. Tom Cruise was in one of his... weird periods back then and the interview cannot be taken seriously, and ABC News ran an article \"Mad Mom?\", a pun of January Jones' role on the TV series \"Mad Men\". (link no longer active)\nHuman placenta is a VERY rare ingredient in Chinese herbal medicine (link is in Chinese), believed to nourish the blood. The official law in China declares placenta to be a medical waste and CANNOT be sold without permission of the mother. That doesn't stop some unscrupulous folks from selling it as a black market item. In many cultures, the placenta is buried in a ceremony after birth to thank it for fulfilling its mission to bring the baby into this world. Thus, eating it would be sacrilegious, and may be considered a form of cannibalism.\nCannibalism is universally considered a taboo as it is counter to the survival of the Homo Sapien species.\nHistorical and Social Perspective\nHistorians pointed out that the propaganda portraying someone as heartless evildoers willing to mutilate the dead is nothing new. The infamous \"German Tallow Factory\" hoax of World War I was a prime example, when the British spread disinformation through their official newspapers about how the Huns (derogatory term for Germans) are making soap out of their own war dead, and attributing it to Belgian sources.\nIt is also the perfect urban legend... just nasty enough"

"usually an opponent will make it clear that he intends to defend and thus it is up to the challenger to fire the first shot. There-after, there is only one aim - to win - and yes, to win at all costs. It is that brutal fact that makes war the hell it is.\n\"War, war, war! All you gen'emen talk of is war!\"\nThus spake the incomparable Scarlett O'Hara, played by the truly beautiful Vivien Leigh, as her very first words in the film of Gone With the Wind. Well, today the talk is also of \"War, war, war\". Mostly, of course, it is concerned with the current kerfuffles in the Middle East but I was intrigued by what I will call the 'non-war' (so far!) over the Ukraine.\nI just wondered - and this is a theoretical rambling not a certitude - whether the new 'weapon of choice' for major powers engaged in a dispute is economics? After all, atomic weaponry is simply not practical if it results in your own total destruction. So-called 'limited' military action between the great powers carries the risks of ultimate escalation and suddenly it's - 'Wham Bam, thanks, Ma'am'!\nBut economic warfare is, by comparison, infinitely more gradual and certainly far removed from loony generals pressing buttons. However, the end results can be catastrophic. One of the unsung contributions to victory in 1918 was the British naval blockade which exerted a strangulating pressure on the German economy forcing them into unrestricted submarine warfare whose only result was to bring into the front line a million or so fresh-faced, well-fed Americans to face a German army on quarter rations!\nThe result of the recent bout of tit-for-tat economic sanctions between Russia and the West is worth watching carefully. Like all warfare, the cost/benefit analysis is a fine one and in fact only experience will confirm who is better placed to survive through an economic war although my money is on capitalist countries with relatively free markets. We can diversify - can Russia?\nFor a more expert opinion particularly in regard to Sino-American realations, try this:\nhttp://n"

Recently, technology has made it easy for scientist to study nano sized admixtures and their effect on microstructure of concrete. This paper reviews nano particles in cement composites and how they can improve different properties of concrete.

": Bloody Hell, Motherly, Girls Nite Out, Orphan: First Kill, Samaritan\nBloody Hell was a Shudder find, and weirdly enough, it was down to Bloody Hell or Motherly, and we ended up catching both. Bloody Hell was the CLEAR winner, though.\nBloody Hell is the story of a man who serves 8 years in prison for thwarting a bank robbery (the story unfolds throughout the movie) and then vacations in Finland at the end of his sentence to get away from the press. The lead is Ben O\u2019Toole, giving a hell of a dual role, and the story is a joy. Just a complete blast here.\nMotherly is also good, if a bit predictable, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the road to the climax is worth it, and the final act is both chilling and darkly humorous. If you have to choose between this and Bloody Hell, watch BH. But if you don\u2019t? See them both!\nIn the wake of Grotesque, the next cult movie watch party was Girls Nite Out, which is not a fitting title. It\u2019s another 80\u2019s slasher without the mayhem of Grotesque. It\u2019s pretty straight forward until you get to the end, which will no doubt make you think of another more famous slasher that actually came AFTER GNO, but did what it does so much better.\nI heard from many people that Orphan: First Kill was another nutso horror offering with a crazy turn. I mean\u2026 it DOES take a turn, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a completely bizarre or noteworthy one. Still, it\u2019s not bad by any stretch (though the camera work and weird shots to make you think Isabelle Fuhrman has not grown up since the predecessor are obnoxious), and it\u2019s great to see Julia Styles still doing stuff.\nSamaritan is very much like Motherly in that you see everything coming from over an hour out, but that didn\u2019t really hurt the ride for me. I will say that whereas Motherly had its best act as the third despite the lack of surprise, Samaritan\u2019s third act was the worst because they could have made the reveal a bit better.\nSt"

"information, see Frame aspect ratio.\nWhen a project is created in Premiere Pro, you set the frame and pixel aspect. Once these ratios are set, you cannot change them for that project. However, you can change the aspect ratio of a sequence. You can also use assets created with different aspect ratios in the project.\nPremiere Pro automatically tries to compensate for the pixel aspect ratio of source files. If an asset still appears distorted, you can manually specify its pixel aspect ratio. Reconcile pixel aspect ratios before reconciling frame aspect ratios, because an incorrect frame aspect ratio can result from a misinterpreted pixel aspect ratio.\nTypes of aspect ratios\nCommonly used aspect ratios are:\nWidescreen (16:9)\nIt is the standard aspect ratio commonly shared by online videos, documentaries, and films. It captures a large amount of data with details.\nVertical (9:16)\nIt is the video recorded on your phone.\nFullscreen (4:3)\nIt is the aspect ratio that was used on television before widescreen was used. It focused on a particular element at a time.\nSquare (1:1)\nIt is a perfect square ratio that is commonly used on Instagram.\nAnamorphic (2.40:1)\nIt is a wide widescreen often used in movies. It is similar to 16:9 but the top and bottom are cropped. This effect gives it a cinematic feel.\nSet the aspect ratio\nTo set the aspect ratio of a sequence:\nCreate a new sequence. Select File > New > Sequence.\nFor more information, see Create and change sequences.\nGo to the Settings tab of the New Sequence dialog box.\nGo to the Settings tab.\nUnder Video, enter the Frame Size(height) and horizontal(width). Premiere Pro automatically generates the aspect ratio.\nFill out the respective fields, name the sequence, and click OK.\nThe aspect ratio for the sequence has been set.\nFrame aspect ratio\nFrame aspect ratio describes the ratio of width to height in the dimensions of an image.

"waiting for the $1.2M bonus kid to take that big step forward developmentally.\nRHP Chance Adams (season review) underwhelmed while repeating Triple-A (4.78 ERA and 4.87 FIP) and is at something of a career crossroads. Early next season might be his last chance to prove he can hack it as a starter. The Yankees have kept him at arm\u2019s length thus far \u2014 his lone big league start was an emergency spot start when Happ went down with hand, foot, and mouth disease. RHP Domingo Acevedo (season review) again battled injuries and was limited to 69.1 innings.\nOther Notable Prospects\nAlmost exactly one year to the day after being selected in the first round of the 2017 draft, RHP Clarke Schmidt completed his Tommy John surgery rehab and made his pro debut. He managed a 3.09 ERA (2.61 FIP) with 33.0% strikeouts and 6.6% walks in 23.1 closely monitored innings in his return, and by all accounts his stuff looked pretty good. Like his pre-Tommy John surgery stuff, basically. Schmidt\u2019s season came to an end in late August with what has been reported as a non-arm injury. Not sure what\u2019s going on there.\n? RHP Matt Sauer, last year\u2019s second round pick, had a weird season with Short Season Staten Island, statistically. He threw more strikes than I expected (6.4% walks) and missed way fewer bats than I expected (15.9% strikeouts and 7.1% swings and misses). The Yankees helped Sauer improve his delivery and tempo and it\u2019s possible this year\u2019s statistical weirdness can be attributed to him adjusting to his new mechanics. I dunno. We\u2019ll see what happens next year.\nRHP Nick Green is one of my favorite prospects in the system. I find him fascinating. He has this funky cutter/sinker hybrid fastball that helped him lead the minors with a 66.4% ground ball rate (min. 130 IP) by nearly five percentage points this season. Green doesn\u2019"

Having near-real time temperature measurements helps to initialize models that are vital to producing accurate hurricane forecasts.\nUnderstanding Harvey's Intensification\nOn Aug. 23, Harvey moved over waters of the southwestern Gulf of Mexico as a tropical depression with a maximum sustained wind speed of 30 knots at 10 p.m. CDT (03 Zulu). Just 24 hours later, Harvey's winds were 75 knots -- a Category 1 hurricane. Another 24 hours later -- just before it hit the south Texas coast -- Harvey's maximum wind speed reached Category 4 status with 115 knot winds.\nGCOOS Members Nan Walker and Alaric Haag (LSU Earth Scan Laboratory, Department of Oceanography and Coastal Sciences, College of the Coast and Environment) and Bob Leben (Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research, University of Colorado Boulder) are using satellite data to help understand how the storm grew so intense so quickly -- key information that will lead to better predictions and forecasts for the intensity of future storms. Read the details.\nUsing Ocean Observing Data in Emergency Preparedness\nGCOOS Member Sanibel Captiva Conservation Foundation (SCCF) located on Sanibel Island in Florida came through Hurricane Irma with no structural or roof damage at its facilities. The Lab lost one weather station and one solar panel.\nDirector Eric Milbrandt reported that the City of Sanibel and Lee County used data from the SCCF's RECON to plan emergency operations during Irma. RECON -- the River, Estuary and Coastal Observing Network -- is the real-time observing network that provides water quality data related to the management of Lake Okeechobee and the 1,400-mile watershed affecting the islands of Sanibel and Captiva.

Overall, 103 of the 144 patients (71.5%) with an increase in dose and/or a re-induction with IFX were able to go back to the standard dose of 5 mg/kg, and 61.9% of patients (13/21) with an increase of dose and a shortening of the interval were able to go back to 5 mg/kg and treatment every 8 weeks.

"of Representatives issued a June 1 missive announcing it had named Renacci its \"Corrupt Republican of the Month,\" a designation whose sole purpose seemed to be providing an excuse for press releases.\n\"Congressman Jim Renacci is under FBI investigation for taking $110,250 in suspect campaign cash and refuses to return the money,\" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Jesse Ferguson said in the release.\nWhile it is clear that the FBI is investigating Suarez Corporation\u2019s donations, PolitiFact Ohio had not heard that Renacci himself was under investigation by the FBI.\nWe asked the DCCC to back up their claim.\nThe DCCC said its assertion was consistent with statements from groups such as Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Government, whose website claims that the FBI is investigating Renacci, and headlines such as this one from the Medina Gazette\u2019s online edition: \"FBI confirms campaign investigation of U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci.\" The article underneath that headline clearly stipulates the FBI is investigating Suarez\u2019 donations to Renacci and Mandel, and states \"The candidates are not accused of any wrongdoing.\"\nWhile a claim on a watchdog website, or sloppy headline could have conveyed the impression that Renacci or his campaign was being investigated by the FBI, none of the news coverage we found on the subject indicated that was the case. To settle the question, we went straight to the source: the Canton office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nIn a June 18 interview, Andrew Hayden, the supervisory senior resident agent of Canton\u2019s Federal Bureau of Investigation office confirmed that Renacci is not a target of the FBI\u2019s investigation.\n\"We are looking into the donations from the Suarez Corporation, and not the congressman\u2019s campaign or the congressman,\" Hayden said.\nIt couldn\u2019t be much clearer than that.

"bulu was. We always planned to leave the house early, sometimes as early as 6am but usually, time would trickle away as we ran around trying to pack the one last convenience that would make the next few days less onerous. Looking back now, they must have sold Nasco cornflakes and powdered milk and Cabin biscuit somewhere close to Ubulu, but we always brought these things from Lagos. My aunt from America, was on another level. She took sweets, chewing gum, cereal, hot chocolate, microwaveable meals, if not for baggage restrictions, she would probably have brought metal canisters labelled Air.\nSometimes, as late as noon we would finally set off. Our mode of travel varied every year. Sometimes it was a bus from my parent's hospital, other times it was a standard four seater car, other times it was a convoy of cars, it depended on how many of us were going. The checkpoints were perhaps the scariest part of the whole drive. They were illegal. Police men with large guns would place wooden planks or barrels across the road and force every car that passed to slow down. Some were waived forward, some were told to park so their papers could be examined. It was entirely random who was stopped. Of course, once stopped, it was expected that you produce a bribe to be let go. I found out that these checkpoints were illegal entirely by accident. One day, we were told to stop when we heard the sounds of a siren convoy behind us. Immediately, the police pushed the barriers away, kicking a plank to the side of the road as if shocked to find it there.\n\"Who said you should stop?\" One shouted at the driver. \"Begin dey go.\"\nOnce, we were stopped on the byroad that allowed you bypass the traffic through Benin City. It was a quiet slip of a road and not many cars used it. These men came out of nowhere. They were not police men but they wore bright yellow tunics over their clothes, as if to lend themselves a degree of fluorescent officiousness. They threw a plank and a barrel in our way and shouted, \"Park here!\"\nThey didn't ask for papers. Instead, there was"
"nings into perspective, 25 cents in 1953 bought a gallon of gas. Mother and Dad hoped I would spend it wisely, and I did due to Mother\u2019s help with my travel arrangements. I spent three glorious weeks visiting the Isom girls in Wichita, Kansas.\nAt this point, my life was beginning to revolve around boys, dating, cruising around in cars, and other teenage activities. Dolls pretty much took a back seat until after I was married and had a little three-year-old daughter. It was Christmas day, 1966, when I met my first Sasha doll , a G\u00f6tz Sasha to be specific. Mother sent a large box to her granddaughter Ellen and when my daughter tore off the wrappings, I was nearly bowled over by the doll inside. I was much more taken with Ellen\u2019s doll than she was. I imagine Mother had looked through a Creative Playthings, Inc. catalogue and liked what she read about Sasha Morgenthaler\u2019s concept. Educational toys had always been stressed on my mother\u2019s side of the family. When she and her siblings were children, they not only had a Schoenhut doll but also the complete Schoenhut circus. Although Ellen played some with her new Sasha, she was never one to spend much time with dolls, even after I made clothing for her new Sasha.\n(Above is a photo of A Christmas Sasha doll for Anne\u2019s daughter Ellen from Grandma.)\nWe\u2019d been living in Wisconsin for three years when Ellen received her Sasha. When we moved there in 1963, I\u2019d packed most of my childhood dolls and animals in a large foot locker and, for safe keeping, put it in the basement of my in-laws, store, which was humidity controlled due to requirements for storing the greenware used in the store\u2019s ceramic classes. My mother-in-law called one night with the most awful news, saying the majority of the contents in my foot locker had been pitched due to water damage. I listened in disbelief. The store next to theirs had caught fire and burned past repair. It was the same Goodwill from where I\u2019d bought my Alma so"
"Augsburg College is a four-year liberal arts college sponsored by the Lutheran Free Church for the purpose of giving young people an opportunity to obtain a broad education in a Christian environment. In addition to a general education, students may prepare themselves for such vocations as high school teaching, business administration, medical technology, secretarial work, parish work, missions, and social work. They may prepare for further study in the fields of dentistry, engineering, law, medicine, nursing, and theology, as well as for graduate study in various fields. The Skminary, with its facilities on the same campus, offers a three-year rheological course leading to a Bachelor of Theology degree. Its purpose is to prepare pastors and missionaries for the Lutheran Free Ohurch. LOCATION Augsburg College and Theological Seminary is located in the Riverside Park area of South Minneapolis, across the Mississippi River from the University of Minnesota and within walking distance of the main business section of the city. Science Hall, containing the administration offices, is located at the corner of Seventh Street and Twenty-first Avenue South. Augsburg students have the advantage of getting their college education in a metropolitan center pulsating with industrial, social, and cultural activities. They have access to libraries, museums, and art collections. They may hear the best in music and lectures. Minneapolis is recognized throughout the nation as a vital center of religious life and activity. Outstanding leaders in many fields both from other parts of America and from foreign countries are frequent visitors. College students in the Twin Cities have abundant opportunity to contact present day life at one of its focal points. HISTORICAL SKETCH Augsburg was begun as a seminary in I 869, at Marshall, W'~sconsin. It was the first theological seminary started by Norwegian Lutherans in America. Through an arrangement with a private institution known as Marshall Academy the Seminary was housed in the academy building. Students who needed further preparation in academic subjects were to obtain this in the academy. This arrangement failed to work out satisfactorily; so the theological group moved to a private dwelling, where classes continued until 1872. In the autumn of that year the Seminary was removed to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where a building had been erected for its use. In"

The perfect franchise to fulfill your hidden desire to fight evil as your favorite superheroes. The lead-up to Avengers: Endgame took eleven years of storytelling. If you\u2019ve binged the entire MCU starting with Captain America: The First Avenger (yes, we\u2019re talking chronologically) then you understand the heartache that happened in Endgame.\nWe said goodbye to iconic actors playing equally iconic roles in the MCU. Could Chris Evans return to his role as Captain America? Here are all the details.\n*spoilers ahead*\nAmerica\u2019s butt\nThat\u2019s right, we\u2019re talking about that butt. It\u2019s Chris Evans. The man who made the role of Captain America what it is today. Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) is arguably the first of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Set in 1942, we see a young Steve Rogers rejected from the military. Of course, that\u2019s not the end of his story.\nSteve Rogers takes a dose of \u201cSuper-Soldier serum\u201d and becomes Captain America. But being Captain America comes at a price as he attempts to take down a warmonger and a terrorist organization. Unfortunately, Rogers ended up crashing the Red Skull\u2019s stealth-winged flying fortress in the Arctic, then waking up in present-day New York City.\nChris Evans got three solo films as Captain America and each was arguably better than the last.

She totally deserves it.)\n. . . and so does her cat.\nMercedes soon begins starving herself, to the point where she faints in the lunchroom. Surprisingly, the only person with anything remotely supportive to say to Mercedes throughout this entire ordeal is Quinn.\nIn a very touching scene, Quinn visits Mercedes in the nurse\u2019s office, offers her a granola bar, and tells her she is beautiful. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been at home in your body. I admired that about you,\u201d Quinn counsels.\nHaving had body issues in the past, and having gained a new understanding about healthy eating, as a result of her pregnancy, Quinn is able to commiserate with Mercedes, and provide her with some good advice. I love the journey the writers have taken with Quinn this season. She has certainly come along way from the shallow self-righteous girl we knew from the pilot.\nAt the pep rally, Mercedes surprises everyone by giving a heart-warming speech about the importance of feeling comfortable in your own skin. She then asks the entire student body to join her in a rendition of Christina Aquilera\u2019s Beautiful, that, in my opinion, was by far, the best performance of the evening.

Prior to the Ukraine invasion, there had already been a number of these incidents reported in the Middle East and China.\nThe report is published at a time when Kenya maritime waters within the Indian Ocean was re-designated from the High-Risk Area (HRA) by the global shipping industry about three months ago. The designation by International Maritime Organisation (IMO), is a relief for shippers who have been suffering for the past eight years.\nIMO is the United Nations (UN) agency responsible for improving the safety and security of global shipping.\nSince 2009 during the heightened piracy cases, cargo ships destined for Mombasa had to use the longest routes, beyond 300 nautical miles from the Indian Ocean coastline, to avoid encountering pirates. Other cargo ships hired private security aboard their ships for increased protection.\nHowever, increased surveillance and joint maritime patrols by the Kenya Coast Guard Services and the Kenya Navy within the Kenyan maritime waters have resulted in a significant reduction in piracy, with no incidents recorded since 2017.<s> Southeast >\nKY: Jackson Purchase Distillery Invests $26 Million in Fulton County, Creating 54 Full-Time Jobs\nJackson Purchase Distillery LLC, a startup bourbon producer, will increase its distilling operation investment in F"

The ongoing advances in computing science mean that knowledge (in the form of insights gleaned from large volumes of detailed data) can increasingly be used to perform predictive analytics, enabling new services and cutting costs. At the same time, the widespread deployment of connected devices, appliances, machines and vehicles (the Internet of Things) now means enterprises can get their hands on granular real-time data, giving them a comprehensive and detailed picture of what is happening now and what is likely to happen next.\nA handful of companies already have a very detailed picture of their markets thanks to far-sighted decisions to add connectivity to the products they sell. Komatsu, for example, uses its Komtrax system to track the activities of almost 430,000 bulldozers, dump-trucks and forklifts belonging to its customers. The Japan-based company has integrated monitoring technologies and connectivity into its construction and mining equipment since the late 1990s. Komatsu says the Komtrax system is standard equipment on \u201cmost Komatsu Tier-3 Construction machines\u201d and on most small utility machines and backhoes.\nKomatsu\u2019s machines ship with GPS chips that can pinpoint their position, together with a unit that gathers engine data. They can then transmit the resulting data to a communication satellite, which relays that information to the Komtrax data centre.\nThe data captured by Komtrax (and other Internet of Things solutions) has value on multiple different levels:\nIt provides Komatsu with market intelligence\nIt enables Komatsu to offer value added services for customers\nIt gives detailed data on the global economy that can be used for computer modelling and to support the development of artificial intelligence\nMarket intelligence for Komatsu\nFor Komatsu, Komtrax provides valuable information about how its customers use its equipment, which can then be used to refine its R&D activities.

", when agents log in and out of the system. Outsourcing providers will also have to guarantee high levels of security \u2013 a trusted relationship and defining the best practices on working from home will not be sufficient.\nMany contact centres will trial different methods \u2013 from installing video surveillance cameras, desktop monitoring tools and access controls. Others will test technologies that can mask the information captured through mobile devices. This presents immense opportunities for vendors, as contact centres will rely heavily on technology to re-invent their security practices.\nContact Centres will Invest in Conversational AI \u2013 Chatbots will No Longer be Enough\nMany enterprises have rushed into deploying chatbots with expectations that these engines can solve the problem of high call volumes. The outcomes have often been poor, leaving customers frustrated and opting to interact with a live agent instead. Implementing a basic chatbot does not fully solve the problem and will force companies back to the drawing board.\nConversational AI offers a different experience by designing multiple forms of dialogues and conversations. It requires conversational design and the algorithms go through rigour from the start. The aim should be to make the channel irresistible \u2013 one that customers have confidence in, and that can reduce the need to email or call an agent. Successful uses cases have shown that conversational AI can reduce calls and repetitive queries by 70-90%. Ecosystm research finds that contact centres are ramping up their self-service capabilities and their adoption of AI and machine learning.\nOffshore Centres will Re-invent Themselves and Make a Comeback\n2020 has seen contact centres in offshore locations struggle to offer services to global clients. Many of these operators have been plagued by poor internet connectivity at agents\u2019 homes, and unfavourable home working environments. These outsourcing locations remain vital however, for multiple reasons \u2013 for example the range of services offered, agent specialisation, costs or diversity in agent profile.\nContact centre outsourcing providers will make a comeback in 2021 and we can expect new models to appear.

"involve time-consuming sample preparation procedure of a sample dissolution which requires the usage of aggressive and toxic chemicals. The need for suitable and sustainable analytical methods for direct multi-elemental analysis of plant samples has been increased in recent years. Spectrometric techniques for direct sample analysis, instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) have been applied in environmental studies and various fields of screening tests. Nevertheless, these techniques are not commonly used for plant sample analysis and their performances need to be evaluated. This research aimed to assess how reliable non-destructive techniques are in the determination of elements in plants compared to conventionally used spectrometric techniques. A total of 49 plant samples of four conifer species (Pinus nigra, Abies alba, Taxus baccata and Larix decidua) were measured using two conventionally applied (ICP-MS, ICP-OES) and two non-destructive techniques (wavelength dispersive XRF (WD-XRF), INAA). The comparison was performed by investigation of relative ratios of concentrations and by correlation analysis. Moreover, precision of the techniques was examined and compared. The quality control included analysis of NIST pine needles certified reference material (1575a) using all examined techniques. Our results suggest that additional analytical and quality control steps are necessary for reaching the highest accuracy of multi-elemental analysis.\",\ntitle = \"Comparison of non-destructive techniques and conventionally used spectrometric techniques for determination of elements in plant samples (coniferous leaves)\",\ndoi = \"10.2298/JSC210921101O\"\nOrli\u0107, J., Ani\u010di\u0107-Uro\u0161evi\u0107, M., Vergel, K., Zinicovscaia, I., Stojadinovi\u0107, S.

Being able to score on special teams is gold in the NFL, and Pettis is the best in NCAA history at it.\nNot much is made of special teams unless they happen to be hurting the team as a whole, and the special teams coordinator is (generally) blamed.

"but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he \"had some woman in New York\" was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.\nAlready it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not alone--fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor's mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.\nI decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I didn't call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone--he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward--and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.\nAbout half way between West Egg and New York the motor-road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land.

"from the typical cliffhanger. Though if it does end up being the series finale I will probably sob like a baby for at least a few months. CSI: Miami is my favorite TV show and the thought of it ending like this just doesn't satisfy me.\nNow I know there are a lot of criticisms about this episode. And I'll be honest, if it weren't for Horatio Caine/David Caruso then I would not watch this show. That being said, I think Jonathan Togo did a phenomenal job in this episode and I think it was great that he finally got a good story line (well, I thought it was a good story line) that spanned over numerous episodes.\nA FEW OTHER THOUGHTS...\n--I think this is the first episode all season that we didn't get that epic keyboard/drum duet before the \"YYYEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHH\". Oh well, not a big deal.\n--Glad to see that Frank and Eric's injuries were still there and didn't just magically disappear.\n--Guess the storyline of Eric getting that prostitute's head in the mail was dropped.\n--Calleigh adopted the kids. :thumbsup: If we do get a Season 11 it will be interesting to see what happens with that.\n--LOL at Dr. Loman's hot girlfriend. :lol: NICE!\n--I would like to see more scenes with the team out at the bar (or other places), we had one at the beginning and end of this episode. And IMO, the bar scene at the end was just perfect, even though I did cry.\nI give this episode an A+.\nSeason 10 was one of the greatest IMO.

The draugr is an undead creature in Norse mythology. While often compared to a zombie, this creature is a bit more sophisticated. In Old Norse, draugr means \u201cghost,\u201d but it\u2019s closer to a vampire. Accounts vary, but generally, the draugr are described as walking dead warriors with superhuman strength, the ability to shapeshift, and the unmistakable stench of decay. They are implacable, seek vengeance and will kill anything that crosses their nightly rampages. In Outpost, these beasties bear these traditional attributes, but they are also given life by an immortal warlock with his own agenda. They are not bound to the night and, because of their otherworldly origin, they appear half somewhere else, are demonic and malevolent, cannot be killed and can only be released by the magician who created them.\nForget honor. While inhumanly strong, the draugr are only as skilled in arms and familiar with the land as the men they once were. Distract and disable. If overrun, flee. \u2013 Outpost, Book One in The Fylking\nGoblins. Nasty, foul-mouthed, wicked creatures. You would not want to cross their path, let alone offend them. Arcmael, the protagonist of Outpost, does both. He is a seer and a servant of the Fylking, immortal, unseen warlords who hold dominion over the realm. Arcmael lands on the bad side of the Otherworld, where most beings revere the Fylking as gods. But goblins revere nothing. They capture Arcmael and throw him in the bowels of their palace.

And so it was again this year. Around two dozen participants across the trade press found their way digitally to an exciting event on 15 March 2022, where (almost) everything revolved around the climate-neutral circular economy.\nAlmost everything, because Ingemar B\u00fchler (photo top left), CEO of Plastics Europe Germany and host of the event, also began by saying a few words about Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which of course could not go unmentioned \u2013 not only for reasons of the impact on supply chains and co \u2013 could not remain unmentioned.

In addition to the enormous opportunities, he also emphasised how difficult the path to this goal still is \u2013 despite excellent theoretical debate, criteria catalogues and innovative research projects.

[723]Again He said to his Apostles:--If ye believe and doubt not, there is nothing ye shall not be able to do. [724]For when our Lord walked on the billows of the sea, Simon also by his faith walked with Him; but when in respect of his faith he doubted, and began to sink, our Lord called him, thou of little faith. [725]And when the Apostles asked of our Lord, they begged nothing at His hands but this, saying to Him:--Increase our faith. He said to them:--If there were in you faith, even a mountain would remove from before you. [726] And He said to them:--Doubt ye not, lest ye sink down in the midst of the world, even as Simon when he doubted began to sink in the midst of the sea.

"early and found Gortat rolling to the rim, a skill which helped him thrive last year in Washington and his years in Phoenix with Steve Nash. As Gortat thrived as a roll man, he gained confidence and was able to take it to Anthony Davis in the post as well. He scored on some pretty hook shots over the shotblocking freak of nature, and he enjoyed it too.\n\"It's fun when you keep scoring and scoring against the best defender in the league. It is a lot of fun.\"\nHe also alluded to the fact that he was not playing at the level he was capable of in recent games.\n\"At the end of the day I believe that I should do this everyday. I needed a game like that. The last two or three games I did not play well. I'm glad I played this game and helped the team to win.\"\nGortat was shooting 42 percent in the 4 games before tonight and the team had been struggling on the defensive end with him as the anchor. A game like this against a player with the defensive reputation of Anthony Davis is sure to boost confidence, and it shows with Gortat when talking about how he can do this every night.\nGortat has gotten flack from Wizards fans in the past regarding his finesse play relative to his size, along with his apparent tendency in the past to get overwhelmed by superior bigs. However, the Wizards have done a terrific job this season against opposing frontcourts, and Gortat has played a big role in that.\nThis might not be an every-night occurrence for Gortat, but a game like this reassures to us what he\u2019s capable of. Consistency from him every night should take this team to newer heights. The Wizards are characterized by their young backcourt, and that often leaves room for people to overlook him. He does not seem to mind, however. A free spirit with a warm personality that lights up the locker room, you don\u2019t expect him to. However, this game, and many others last year, especially in Nene\u2019s absence, shows us all one thing: The barometer for the Wizards success is characterized by a man nicknamed \"The Polish Hammer.\"\nWizards vs. Pelicans: Pierce,"

"ay, this is no longer the case. Sussman pointed out that engineers now routinely write code for complicated hardware that they don\u2019t fully understand (and often can\u2019t understand because of trade secrecy.) The same is true at the software level, since programming environments consist of gigantic libraries with enormous functionality. According to Sussman, his students spend most of their time reading manuals for these libraries to figure out how to stitch them together to get a job done. He said that programming today is \u201cMore like science. You grab this piece of library and you poke at it. You write programs that poke it and see what it does. And you say, \u2018Can I tweak it to do the thing I want?'\u201d. The \u201canalysis-by-synthesis\u201d view of SICP \u2014 where you build a larger system out of smaller, simple parts \u2014 became irrelevant. Nowadays, we do programming by poking.\nAlso, see the Hacker news thread. I thought this comment was useful:\nWhat should we consider fundamental?\nA fair question, and a full answer would be too long for a comment (though it would fit in a blog post, which I'll go ahead and write now since this seems to be an issue). But I'll take a whack at the TL;DR version here.\nAI, ML, and NLP and web design are application areas, not fundamentals. (You didn't list computer graphics, computer vision, robotics, embedded systems -- all applications, not fundamentals.) You can cover all the set theory and graph theory you need in a day. Most people get this in high school. The stuff you need is just not that complicated. You can safely skip category theory. What you do need is some amount of time spent on the idea that computer programs are mathematical objects which can be reasoned about mathematically. This is the part that the vast majority of people are missing nowadays, and it can be a little tricky to wrap your brain around at first. You need to understand what a fixed point is and why it matters. You need automata theory, but again, the basics are really not that complicated. You need to know about Turing-completeness, and that in addition to Turing machines there are PDAs and FSAs. You need to know that TMs can do things that PDAs can't (like parse"

"\u2019ll know the \u201clatest\u201d winner of the Air Force tanker competition in December, more than five years after the process first began.\nThe new deadline was announced yesterday by senior Defense Department officials, who outlined procedures for re-opening the contract bidding process. They told a Pentagon press conference that a new request for proposals (RFP) is expected late this month, or in early August. That will allow the competing firms, Boeing and Northrop-Grumman, to re-bid \u201cwholly new proposals,\u201d with the winner being announced by the end of the year.\nWhile movement in the long-delayed tanker program is certainly welcome news, yesterday\u2019s announcement was another black eye for the Air Force. During yesterday\u2019s press conference, the same DoD officials (Defense Secretary Robert Gates; acting Air Force Secretary Mike Donley and Pentagon Acquisition Chief John Young) revealed new plans for handling the tanker bids.\nUnder the modified acquisition process, Mr. Young\u2019s office will not only make the final selection, it will also lead a newly-formed, source selection advisory committee. Normally, most of those advisory functions (short of final selection) are performed by the military services.\nWashington Democratic Congressman Norman Dicks explained the reason for change rather succinctly, observing that \u201cno one trusts the Air Force.\u201d That might be an understatement. After screwing up the process two times previously, the service has been given a backseat in the third round of contract bidding. Think of it as Mr. Gates affirmation that Air Force acquisition is hard broke.\nThe latest round of bidding became necessary when the Government Accountability Office found flaws in the service\u2019s last tanker choice, announced earlier this year. In a highly-controversial decision, the Air Force selected Northrop-Grumman to build its next generation of air refueling planes, using the Airbus A330 airframe.\nBoeing protested the decision, claiming (among other things) that Northrop-Grumman had been given \u201cextra credit\u201d for offering a larger aircraft, criteria not found in the original contract specifications. A GAO review upheld the Boeing protest, determining that the Air Force made a number of \u201csignificant errors\u201d in making"

Then again, one hallmark of our show is that everyone is entitled to their opinions, even when those opinions are wrong and dumb.\nSpeaking of opinions that are wrong and dumb, 1975 also marked the beginnings of what became the Men\u2019s Rights Movement. Though at first it was really just a pleasant adjunct to feminism, a way to examine how rigid notions of masculinity could be harmful to dudes. Fair enough! Later, the movement split into different factions, including one faction that held the kinds of sensitivity retreats that were well-meaning but also easy to mock. And then another faction that grew neckbeards and developed strong opinions about custody laws and ethics in videogame journalism, which opinions they like to shout at feminists on Twitter and elsewhere on the internet.\nWe\u2019ve got plenty of other 1975 stuff on this week\u2019s episode, too, but we won\u2019t spoil it for you.

", who was represented by attorneys from the Bluhm Legal Clinic at Northwestern University School of Law.\nWhile there was no physical evidence linking them to the crime, Mr. Reeves and Mr. Kitchen were found guilty in 1988 of murdering two women and three children and setting their house on fire. The conviction came partially as a result of unsubstantiated testimony of a convict, who was incarcerated at the time of the killings, that Reeves and Kitchen were drug dealers and that Mr. Kitchen admitted in a phone call with him in prison to killing the victims over a drug debt. No independent evidence was offered at trial that Mr. Reeves ever dealt drugs.\nMr. Kitchen was sentenced to death for the crime, partially due to the confession he gave after being beaten by Detective Michael Kill, a subordinate of former Chicago Police Commander Jon Burge. Commander Burge has been indicted by the US Attorney\u2019s Office in Chicago for perjury related to alleged torture under his command. In addition to this abuse, the defense argued that prosecutors failed to turn over exculpatory evidence during their trials, specifically that, in exchange for his testimony, the witness had been put in work release and his girlfriend was given cash to move into a larger apartment where she could live with the witness.\nMr. Reeves\u2019 attorney, Mayer Brown partner Michael J. Gill said, \u201cMarvin Reeves lost 20 years of his life because a witness sold false testimony against him for a get out of jail free card and 30 pieces of silver. Despite that false testimony, Marvin would have had a fighting chances at a trial if the State had disclosed, as it was required, the price it had paid for that testimony.\u201d\nMr. Gill added, \u201cAlthough no one can give back to Marvin those 20 years, the Attorney General\u2019s decision today is a principled one that gives Marvin the rest of his life.\u201d\nMayer Brown associate David D.

"warrant takedowns. This could easily change if Bitcoin becomes a popular way to share child sexual abuse material. Simply having these illegal images on your hard drive is a felony, which could have significant repercussions for anyone involved in Bitcoin.\nWhichever scenario plays out, this may be the Achilles heel of Bitcoin as a global currency.\nIf an open network such as a blockchain were threatened by a powerful organization\u2014China\u2019s censors, Disney\u2019s lawyers, or the FBI trying to take down a more dangerous botnet\u2014it could fragment into multiple networks. That\u2019s not just a nuisance, but an existential risk to Bitcoin.\nSuppose Bitcoin were fragmented into 10 smaller blockchains, perhaps by geography: one in China, another in the US, and so on. These fragments might retain their original users, and by ordinary logic, nothing would have changed. But Metcalfe\u2019s law implies that the overall value of these blockchain fragments combined would be a mere tenth of the original. That is because the value of an open network relates to how many others you can communicate with\u2014and, in a blockchain, transact with. Since the security of bitcoin currency is achieved through expensive computations, fragmented blockchains are also easier to attack in a conventional manner\u2014through a 51 percent attack\u2014by an organized attacker. This is especially the case if the smaller blockchains all use the same hash function, as they would here.\nTraditional currencies are generally not vulnerable to these sorts of asymmetric threats. There are no viable small-scale attacks against the US dollar, or almost any other fiat currency. The institutions and beliefs that give money its value are deep-seated, despite instances of currency hyperinflation.\nThe only notable attacks against fiat currencies are in the form of counterfeiting. Even in the past, when counterfeit bills were common, attacks could be thwarted. Counterfeiters require specialized equipment and are vulnerable to law enforcement discovery and arrest. Furthermore, most money today\u2014even if it\u2019s nominally in a fiat currency\u2014doesn\u2019t exist in paper form.\nBitcoin attracted a following for its openness and immunity from government control.

"a laser 230 for BDs, a laser for DVDs and a laser 240 for CDs are turned on in this order with a spindle motor 304 turned OFF. Each time a laser is turned on, the corresponding objective lens is oriented in the focus direction to perform focus-related measurement. A difference in the substrate thickness is detected based on then obtained FE signal amplitude, FE signal symmetry, number of s-shaped waveforms of an FE signal, and focus driving value (focus-achieved voltage value) to discriminate between a BD, a DVD and a CD.\nWhile the spindle motor is kept OFF in this embodiment, the spindle motor 304 may be turned ON when it is desired to save the operation time. Or, the spindle motor 304 may be turned OFF only when the BD laser is driven to perform focus measurement. In this way, it is possible to prevent the objective lens 210 for BDs from coming into contact with the optical disk 301.\nWhen a voltage is supplied to the focus driving coil 305 to bring the objective lenses 210, 220 closer to the optical disk 301 from a distance to the same, a focus error value (FE value) is measured. In the measurement result, the FE values are represented in an s-curve as shown in FIG. 2(b). The zero-crossing points of the s-curve, FBD, FDVD and FCD are called the focus driving value of respective lasers.\nCalculation of a difference in the focus driving error will be described based on FIG. 3.

Thus we may distinguish the superior parts without distinguishing the inferior, but not vice versa.\nAs this idea of punctuation is at least new and curious, it may deserve a little further illustration.\nAs this cruel practice of party lying tends to the utter subversion of all truth and humanity among us, it deserves the utmost detestation and discouragement of all who have either the love of their country, or the honour of their religion at heart. Spectator, No. 451.\nThis sentence has but two commas in it, as it lies in the Spectator before me: but who is there of the least discernment who does not perceive a great number of other pauses, which might be adopted for the purpose of more distinctly conveying the sense? In the first place, the compound nominative contains a class of words ending at lying, which are united as forming the subject of the verb, tends; which may be very properly distinguished from the next class of words which form the object of the verb; and as this object is compounded of two subordinate classes, namely; the utter subversion, and of all truth and humanity among us; we may pause better at subversion than in any other part of this clause; and as the next principal constructive member has for its nominative a single word, and that only a personal pronoun, it admits of no pause after it: but the regimen of the succeeding verb, consisting of several classes of words, requires a pause after the verb, to distinguish it from the regimen, and a pause at discouragement, to distinguish the class which forms the former part of the regimen from the latter; and a pause at all, to distinguish the persons understood by this word and the\nnext member, which describes them; and this last descriptive member, beginning with the nominative who, and the verb have, being followed by another compound member consisting of two parts, which form the regimen of the verb, must have a pause"

ACA results from persistent spirochetal infection, however, ACA is not restricted to European patients. \u201cAcrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) is a slowly progressive lesion located primarily on the extensor (acral) surfaces of the extremities. This chronic lesion, which has inflammatory and atrophic phases, sometimes with fibrotic features, results from persistent spirochetal infection (3, 26). In the United States, Lyme disease is caused only by B. burgdorferi. There, EM lesions are a feature of the illness, but not BL or ACA lesions (38).\u201d\n4 weeks of Doxycycline failed to eliminate ACA (persistent Lyme). \u201cMost patients with EM were treated with oral doxycycline for 2 or 3 weeks, and those with BL or ACA were usually given 4 weeks of this medication.

All patients responded to therapy, but in several patients with ACA, skin atrophy persisted or neuropathy resolved slowly.\u201d\nVarying Borrelia species can cause ACA. \u201cAlthough B. afzelii is the most common cause of ACA, each of these Borrelia species has now been recovered from ACA lesions (21,"

The Viable System Model is recursive: that is that each system is embedded in a number of other more comprehensive subsystems ranging from authority relationships to community and regulatory ones. These are not authority relations in the strict sense as, although a community has standards and norms, and a regulatory body its rules, these apply primarily within strict boundaries or parameters. These homeostats and recursive relationships do not follow a normal ordinal pattern or straightforward time scale. A lower level of recursion may be (e.g. the \u2018grass roots\u2019 where the most far reaching potential innovations are explored while the more comprehensive level may be constrained to pursue mainly those \u2018possible futures\u2019 that are acceptable to the full range of their members. They may have shorter or longer feedback cycles and they may be working within frameworks that are anywhere from hundreds of years old to yesterday.

There was a small part of me concerned that the cradle might not grip the light in a couple of years, but it's done exactly what it needs to during the test period \u2013 the light hasn't budged once, and I've appreciated the option of mounting it above or below the bar.\nExposure has used this mount for over 10 years and, reassuringly, the light comes with a two-year warranty.

It\u2019s a long way from Wodehouse, and definitely involves humour of another kind.\nMax Liu, in a review for The Independent , says:\n\u201cHe articulates a kind of business class existentialism, which is difficult to get excited about, and The Dog is composed of deliberately convoluted sentences which thwart the reader\u2019s absorption.\u201d\nBut one man\u2019s idea of \u2018con"
"? EMKA investment casting.\nSince 2015 an important part of the EMKA Group \u2013 4,000,000 parts produced per year\nIt was only in 2015 that EMKA Feinguss became part of the EMKA Group. Today, 192 employees are responsible for producing investment castings from steel and stainless steel in all qualities and alloys. With modern technology, it is possible to produce castings between 0.5 g and 10 kg and up to 250 mm long.\nThe parts are finished mechanically in modern machining centres or electrochemically by electroplating. On about 10,500 m2, 4 million parts and 400 tons of material are processed annually. EMKA Feinguss is also highly certified: according to ISO 9001:2015 and IATF 16949:2016.\nFine parts for the industry\nWhether mechanical engineering, automotive or electrical industry: EMKA Feinguss manufactures essential parts for many different industries. In addition to the part\u2019s geometry, the surface condition of the investment castings is particularly important for the different fields of application.\nIn addition to brushed, rough and galvanised surfaces, EMKA Feinguss also uses electrolytic polishing and passivation in order to ensure the desired and appropriate condition.\nThe investment casting production services range from application consulting to project planning, series production and finishing to certification in the EMKA test laboratory and the subsequent logistics controlled by EMKA.\nA brief insight into the production process: Here, the wax injection process first takes effect. The wax patterns (replicas) are produced using aluminium, brass or steel tools and form a positive model of the casting to be produced. The actual casting mould is created by alternately immersing the casting cluster in a ceramic slurry and fine sand. With this process, up to nine layers are built up, which in the end represent the actual casting mould.\nThe actual casting process takes place directly in the still-hot mould, where the liquid metal can flow into the cavities created by the wax model.

"ure. But all in all, an enjoyable film which has left an impression. I always appreciate watching unpolished characters navigating circumstances plotted outside their usual courses, then watching how they deal with the inevitable implosion. From what I've read since, the film was one which perhaps accurately portrayed the director's life at the time of filming; dealing with various booze-infused demons. That rawness definitely shows, as does the inevitable imperfections in this movie's execution.<s> Notre Dame football: Kelly, Irish eye season opener\nBob Wieneke\nBWieneke@schurz.com\nWhen Brian Kelly first met with the media at the start of fall camp, one of his early messages was how the team began to steer toward the 2013 season the day after the Jan. 7 BCS National Championship Game loss to Alabama.\nOn Thursday, during the school's media day at Notre Dame Stadium, Kelly reiterated that the time to move past the 12-0 regular season is, well, in the past.\n\"There hasn't been a lot of, 'This is what we did last year,'\" Kelly said. \"The focus has been on this year. That's what we went to work on after the championship loss.\"\nWhat Kelly also sees is a different team personality-wise, particularly with the departure of star player and inspirational leader Manti Te'o.\n\"Sometimes we took on his personality as a team,\" Kelly said of Te'o.\nIn this group, the word consistency came to mind.\n\"They come to work every day with a consistency,\" Kelly said. \"I know what I'm going to get from them.\"\nStar defensive end Stephon Tuitt left the field during the media-viewing portion of Thursday's practice after colliding with Carlo Calabrese. Kelly termed it a twisted knee and said that doctors didn't see \"anything major.\"\n\"We're not concerned at all,\" Kelly said.\nKelly also said that defensive end Tony Springmann will miss the season because of knee surgery.\nSophomore offensive tackle Ronnie Stanley, who is in the mix to win a starting job, sat out Thursday's practice because of a"
"open the government to a not-so thrilled Republican caucus.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) will have his work cut out Tuesday morning, when he updates Republican lawmakers on ongoing negotiations to cobble together a budget plan that would end a two-week-old partial government shutdown and avoid a manufactured, non-existent default on U.S. government debt.\nMinority Leader McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) wrapped up negotiations late Monday, which ironed out the specifics of an emerging budget proposal after a string of prior plans tanked in the Senate thanks to Harry Reid.\nReid appeared on the chamber floor Monday night very optimistic, and announced, \u201cWe\u2019ve made tremendous progress\u2013we are not there yet\u2013but tremendous progress, and everyone just needs to be patient.\u201d\nMcConnell added, \u201cWe\u2019ve had a good day\u2026I think it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019ve made substantial progress and we look forward to making more progress in the near future.\u201d\nAround the same time that McConnell will meet with Republican Senators, House GOP leaders will be meeting with their more conservative rank-and-file, many of whom are already skeptical toward the details of the negotiations that were dripping out Monday night.\nAnd they should be, because Democrats offered no real concessions \u2014 save for verification that Obamacare recipients are legal \u2014 while Democrats will again except another bloc from Obamacare taxes the rest of Americans will still be on the hook for.

"and A9 cores. When split, secure domains are established and hardware mailboxes and semaphores are used for interprocessor communications.\nAdditionally, software functions can be divided between the two cores. This can be advantageous in applications requiring software certification (e.g. FAA for aviation or FDA for medical) where segmenting functions and having a clear, but physically limited communication path across domains, can reduce both risk of bugs and certification testing rigor and expense. This includes physically different nonvolatile storage devices for the M4 and A9, which enables segmentation and separation of operating system and application code, as well as data. On the Fury-X, M4 code can be stored in the processor\u2019s internal memory or QSPI flash while A9 code is typically stored within eMMC flash memory.\nThe M4/A9 architecture also enables fast system boot. The M4 can complete boot and start executing application code within tens of millisecondswhile the A9 boots a more complex operating system, such asLinux, which can require 20 to 30 seconds. Therefore, the M4 can commence device critical operations or simple display output while the A9 completes boot.\nThe Fury-X: Board Architecture Made for Networking and Rugged Deployment\nThe 6SoloX heterogeneous architecture enables efficient implementation of applications when both microcontroller and a microprocessor are appropriately utilized. However, the circuitry surrounding the processor must be supportive of its capabilities to take advantage of power optimization, security, and application. The Fury-X does just that.\nFirst, to enable network connectivity, Fury-X provides wired Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee interfaces and a mPCIe slot for expansion modules, such as cellular modems. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee are implemented in a single radio capable of running the full network stacks, allowing either the M4 or A9 cores to manage communications. Both Bluetooth and ZigBee are optional; the Fury-X can be ordered with a Wi-Fi only module for cost savings. Fury-X Wi-Fi includes enterprise-level security.\nThe 6SoloX includes two Gigabit Ethernet MACs and can provide a switching function without the addition of a switch IC"

", Emilie Hooft, and Paul Bedrosian\nVolcanic activity is dictated by crustal pathways and reservoirs through which magma ascends and collects. The Cascades are a natural laboratory to study the influence of the crust on erupted magmas and subterranean reservoirs. The interaction of ascending magmas with the variable subduction geometry and tectonics of the overriding North American plate has given rise to a diversity of magmatic storage conditions. The confluence of geochemical and geophysical investigations emphasizes that most magmatic systems in the Cascades have been built at multiple levels in the crust, as determined by tectonics, pre-existing structure, and magmatic flux from the mantle.\nBy Nicole E. Moore and Lynn Robinson\nThe Cascadia subduction zone continuously shapes the landscape of the Pacific Northwest of North America and the cultures of its inhabitants. The impacts of subduction processes on Pacific Northwest societies and cultures are varied, but Native Americans and European settler cultures alike have described geological processes through oral histories and have relied on resources provided by the subduction zone. Indigenous peoples focus many aspects of their religious practices and art around the geohazards of the Cascadia region, and our melded modern cultures continue to take part in storytelling related to subduction zone hazards through movies and other forms of narration.\nBy Elizabeth G. Westby, Andrew Meigs, and Chris Goldfinger\nSubduction zones produce some of Earth\u2019s most devastating geological events. Recent eruptions of Mount St. Helens and great earthquakes and tsunamis in Japan and Sumatra provide stark examples of the destructive power of subduction-related hazards. In the Cascadia subduction zone, large earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions have occurred in the past and geologic records imply that these events will occur in the future. As the population and infrastructure increase in the region, resilience to these natural hazards requires a detailed scientific understanding of the geologic forces and processes involved, combined with a society motivated to mitigate"

I performed these tasks as part of my role as an expert on an advisory panel to the FDA concerning RBM issues.\nFifty-one people responded to the survey. Participant organizations include CROs (21); sponsors (23); and other vendors (7). One respondent answered the survey twice. Only one of the responses was counted. One sponsor had two respondents. That sponsor was counted once for items such as whether RBM was adopted, but all responses for barriers to adoption were collected. The survey included representatives from large, mid-sized, and small pharma/biotechs, and vaccines and medical device companies. The CRO category included large, mid-sized, and small/niche CROs and contract monitors. The \u201cother vendor\u201d classification included consultants (i.e., clinical trial managers, data managers), an independent review board (IRB) representative, a representative from a site organization, and technology vendors.\nCROs adopted RBM at a slightly higher rate (71%) than sponsors (64%). Of those that did not adopt RBM, most were small/niche CROs and small biotech companies, though one mid-sized pharma had not adopted RBM.\nAll but one of the CROs that had not adopted RBM and all of the sponsors that had not adopted RBM were small companies.\nDifferent RBM definitions\nNearly every respondent defined RBM differently and proposed a different RBM implementation approach. The lack of a common RBM definition and understanding of what RBM does represented critical barriers to adopting the method.\nMany of the definitions and implementation approaches included reduced source data verification (SDV), SDV only of critical endpoints, and terms such as central monitoring of case report forms (CRFs), but most still depended on on-site monitoring.

If we were to bust in on a conventional peach harvest, we\u2019d likely find a similar dark-skinned cast of characters doing the dirty work and shouldering the various occupational hazards that go along.\nThe black (or, as some say, gray) market for marijuana keeps the truth about growers, their employment practices, and their product\u2019s destination in obscurity.\nAnother illogical and self-serving conclusion of Patterson\u2019s is his projection about how ending marijuana prohibition would increase the difficulty of his job. Legalization won\u2019t make Patterson\u2019s work harder\u2014though it may render his department\u2019s services suddenly out of demand. Ending prohibition takes the profit motive out of the black market\u2014that\u2019s why hikers in California bear no risk of stumbling upon moonshine operations.\nMonica Bell\nI\u2019m curious where Deputy Patterson studied economics. His reasoning that lessening the penalties for marijuana would encourage illicit cartel grows on public land is completely misguided.\nFirst, decriminalizing marijuana takes penalties away only from the user, not the grower or supplier. This means that there is just as much of a negative incentive facing these growers.\nTaxing and regulating marijuana would lessen the penalties for producing marijuana, but that would surely mean that there would be far fewer of these grow sites. After all, the only reason to hide these sites deep in the wilderness is to avoid detection and arrest. You don\u2019t see illicit vineyards"

Alexei Sayle, the avant-garde proponent of Britain\u2019s alternative comedy scene in the 1980s, was there to help make sure we all had fun too.\nHis talk, \u2018Thatcher Made Me Laugh\u2019 was another sell-out and had the audiences in stitches. Even though Sayle hasn\u2019t really been considered revolutionary for 30 years, the fact he was the only festival speaker to openly identify as a communist automatically made him one of the most interesting and dangerous.\nThe fact he was on The Young Ones helped too.

Her conservation with Grant covered important topics such as the failure of the prison system to adequately mete out justice, the right of individuals and communities to resist, violently if need be, and the ongoing challenges faced by people of colour due to a legacy of colonisation.\nHer critiques of prison and affirmative action (according to Garza it \u201coverwhelmingly benefits white women\u201d more than any other group) clearly made the audience feel uncomfort"

The need was for the development of evangelical church leaders to respond appropriately to the cultural, educational, economic, and social challenges of the Caribbean.\nThe Missionary Church Association in Jamaica launched JTS in Kingston.

Forecasts for the shareholder returns had varied sharply ahead of the report, as analysts weighed expectations for bumper earnings against last week\u2019s notice on working capital.\nThe company said it expects more normalized trading performance in the second half. Its long-term forecast range would put the trading business on track for about $5 billion of profit in 2022.\nGlencore is the latest of the big diversified mining companies to report, following Rio Tinto and Anglo American Plc last week.

We address each of them, beginning with whether the energy intensity of producing all materials used in batteries or that of battery assembly is greater. Notably, battery assembly energy intensity depends on assembly facility throughput because energy consumption of equipment, especially the dry room, is mainly throughput-independent. Low-throughput facilities therefore will have higher energy intensities than near-capacity facilities. In our analysis, adopting an assembly energy intensity reflective of a low-throughput plant caused the assembly stage to dominate cr"
"greedy corporations.\nThe film\u2019s early sequences are punctuated by fake commercials for Gemma\u2019s toys, all of which ring true to the bizarre creatures that have currently taken root in my own kids\u2019 playroom. (None are arguably as weird as the robo-fish that flops around whenever my children submerge it in water.) And Johnstone even has some twisted fun with poor Cady\u2019s horrific backstory, and with Gemma\u2019s eagerness to outsource her parental responsibilities onto M3GAN. The doll\u2019s programming allows her to dispense folksy wisdom, hound Cady (in a sweet and patient way) about flushing the toilet or washing her hands, and even to sing to her a lullaby when the mood strikes.\nOf course, M3GAN \u2014 embodied by actress Amie Donald, voiced by Jenna Davis, and seemingly augmented by a fair amount of animatronic special effects \u2014 begins to take her role as surrogate caretaker so seriously that she views anyone who upsets Cady\u2019s happiness, even temporarily or for the greater good, as a threat. And when they happens, no one is safe.\nThe premise of this deranged, homicidal, yet oddly loving doll is ridiculous, and Cooper and Wan\u2019s story treats it appropriately. They previously collaborated on the 2021 horror film Malignant, a delightfully bizarre thriller about a woman stricken with nightmarish visions of actual murders. The concept was unexceptional but the film\u2019s third-act twists were absolutely bonkers; that movie seemed designed less to make people scream in terror than to shriek with incredulous and sadistic pleasure. In its best moments, like when Cady begins to trust and like M3GAN more than Gemma and demands her doll accompany them on a trip to a new school, M3GAN achieves a similarly outlandish vibe: Not so much scary as ghoulishly hilarious.\nIt\u2019s aided tremendously by McGraw and Williams, both of whom are willing to push their characters into abrasive and even unlikable territory, which is key to the success"
"plays Sultan\u2019s childhood friend Govind who impresses the most, despite this not being his debut film Sultan is what would go on to be a turning point in his career I guess. Anushka Sharma as mentioned earlier gets a meaty role as Aarfa and plays the ideal foil to Salman\u2019s Sultan. She plays a spirited character who takes the emotional distress to heart with a lot of conviction. Salman is good in his slightly restrained avatar and is the life of the film indeed. Though Sultan is no game changer it is still a commendable Salman Khan film, one where we more or less root for him with the slogan \u201ckar de chatai\u201d as he tries to size up as his opponents in the ring. Ali Abbas Zafar manages to make a mark for himself with this love story against a wrestling backdrop and I wouldn\u2019t really be a surprise if Sultan goes on to be accepted widely, both by fans of Salman Khan and the aam aadmi as well.\nPosted bySethumadhavan July 7, 2016 July 15, 2016 Posted inBollywood, Hindi, ReviewsTags:aditya chopra, Amit Sadh, Anant Sharma, Anushka Sharma, Artur Zurawaski, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Kumud Mishra, Movie Review, Parikshit Sahni, Rameshwar S.Bhagat, Randeep Hooda, Salman Khan, Sultan, Sultan Movie Review, Vishal-Shekhar, Yash Raj Films, YRF\nPublished by Sethumadhavan\nMovie enthusiast,avid blogger on cinema of all kinds especially regional cinema and focused on the entertainment business too.Loves to talk about movie marketing,, film distribution & the smaller/indie films of course !!!

This is also true for inflation, as businesses saw a reduction in input costs, according to a new business survey. At 55.2, the headline S&P Global Dubai Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) remained firmly above the 50.0 no change mark in December to indicate a strong improvement in operating conditions across the non-oil sector. The index improved slightly from 54.9 in November, but nonetheless was at its second lowest since April. Dubai\u2019s output growth remained strong in non-oil economy but slipped to weakest since February. The PMI survey signaled a robust expansion in output levels on the back of new order volumes and improving customer demand. \"Growth in Dubai non-oil activity slipped to its softest rate for ten months Wednesday, 11 January 2023 in December, but nonetheless remained robust and stronger than the average seen since the survey began in 2010,\" David Owen, Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said. New business growth also remained down, while job creation slipped to the weakest since September. Sharp increases were seen in construction, wholesale & retail, and travel & tourism. New work received by construction firms rose at the strongest rate in nearly two years. Firms were less upbeat about future activity levels in December, with positivity slipping to a four-month low. Employment opportunities in December failed to rise due to weaker output forecasts. By sector, job growth was mainly driven by the construction and wholesale-and-retail categories, whereas staffing was broadly unchanged in travel and tourism. (Zawya) "

"Plateau (QTP) populations, some of which are involved in DNA repair and the ubiquitin system and potential candidates involved in high-altitude adaptation. Notably, we detected a single base mutation causing loss-of-function of the FLOWERING LOCUS C protein, responsible for the transition to early flowering in high-elevation populations.\nOur results provide a genome-wide perspective of how plants adapt to distinct environmental conditions across extreme elevation differences and the potential for further follow-up research with extensive data from additional populations and species.\nA cornerstone of biodiversity is that different species occupy specific ecological niches [1]. Each species has a range of distribution; some species are very narrow, and some can be widely distributed around the world [2, 3]. Altitude gradient, as an important index of spatial niche measurement, greatly affects the distribution range and pattern of organisms. Climate conditions vary greatly in different altitude regions [4]. Compared with low-altitude areas, high-altitude areas often have extreme environments including low temperature, low oxygen, poor soils, and strong ultraviolet (UV) radiation [5]. Only very few species can live across an elevation range greater than 4000 m from sea level to high altitude. Understanding how these species adapt to different environments with such a large altitude span can make a significant contribution to evolutionary ecology. It is difficult to demonstrate how wild species adapt to their local environments without genomics tools, because the mechanisms of ecological adaptation are very complex and involve multi-gene interactions at the genomic level rather than single-gene mutations [6, 7]. Previous genome-wide studies on adaptive evolution in distinct environments with great altitude differences have focused mainly on humans and vertebrates [8, 9]. Recently, several studies have reported the genetic architectures and evolutionary processes driving the adaption of alpine plants along altitudinal gradients [10,11,12]. However, local adaptation of alpine plants across the extreme altitude gradient (~\u20094000\u2009m) on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is very scarce.\nField pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) is an annual diploid (2n ="

Photo by Leiko Napoli\nAn ease of execution arises when musicians achieve full mastery of a creative medium like jazz. The relaxed energy evident in this authority emanated from all four corners of the Jerry Bergonzi Quartet Sunday at Bar Centro. This allowed many outlets of excitement, ideas, passion and soulful style. The most stunning moment came quite soon, when the tenor saxophonist-leader, in effect, cut off the right arm of John Coltrane.\nIn that act, he demonstrated mastery of his own voice, laden as it is with influences. I\u2019ll get to my perhaps-startling metaphor shortly.\nThe quartet opened with a \u201csimple blues\u201d they titled \u201cLet\u2019s Pretend,\u201d which Bergonzi revealed afterwards as his adaptation of Coltrane\u2019s \u201cVillage Blues.\u201d That tune, from the classic Coltrane Quartet\u2019s first recording in 1961, affirmed Bergonzi\u2019s deep sense of modern jazz tradition. It\u2019s a terse four-note phrase, extended slightly. Bergonzi asserted a powerful Trane-ish tight-reed tone that allowed fiery expression through discipline. Yet it helped the band warm up their chops perfectly. Bassist Billy Peterson especially showed he was poised for the show, with elastic, throbbingly-musical dexterity.\nGear-shift to a fast tempo for the standard \u201cGreen Dolphin Street\u201d but here \u201cde-harmonized\u201d and with other alterations, Bergonzi explained. What happened would\u2019ve stunned Coltrane were he sitting in the crowd. He once famously declared that he would \u201cgive his right arm to play like Stan Getz.\u201d Sure enough, we witnessed \u2014 in a few short moments \u2014 Bergonzi shift from Coltrane to Getz mode. Not many saxophonists can do this with such swift execution.\nSo suddenly his sinuous solo sounded at once"

"I know I say that every single time they have less than five, but seriously, sometimes they have six, and that's just too many.\nFor Alcohol Awareness Week, Figgins tasked the glee club with coming up with something for an assembly at the end of the week. This somehow led them to suddenly desire having a party thanks to Rachel's dads being out of town, where they all got really drunk, which led to a hot kiss between Rachel and Blaine... and can I just say? Those two have more chemistry than Rachel and Finn. Am I alone in thinking that? Their duet was kind of great, too. Rachel decided she wanted to try and take the relationship further, and asked Blaine out on a date. He agree, suddenly unsure of whether he was actually gay or not, since he'd never really had a boyfriend either. Kurt freaks out about it, as he tends to do a lot lately. In the end, when Rachel kisses him while they're both sober, Blaine decides that he really is gay, so it was only a brief flirtation with the ladies.\nMeanwhile, Beiste told Will that he really needed to de-stress and relax after everything that's been going on in his life lately. She took him to Rosalita's Roadhouse, a honky tonk bar, and he got totally wasted. He ended up drunk dialing Emma, or so he thought. I think we all knew as soon as Sue's name showed up on his phone that he would accidentally dial her. But that didn't stop her from doing the obvious and playing the message over the speaker phone for the entire school to hear. The dangers of drunk dialing, to be sure.\nAnd what happened at the big assembly? The kids decided to perform a Ke$ha song, but ended up getting sick in the middle of it thanks to all of the drinking they'd been doing. Figgins thinks it was all acting on their part, and congratulates them on a job well done, because the kids in school have stopped showing up drunk. I don't know if school is different now, but I hardly ever recall seeing people drunk at school. This comes as a surprise to absolutely no one, I'm sure.\n"
"recent trend (so-called Web 2.0) has been away from Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) based services towards more direct Representational State Transfer (REST) style communications[5]. Web APIs allow the combination of multiple services into new applications known as mashups [6].\nThe POSIX standard defines an API that allows a wide range of common computing functions to be written such that they may operate on many different systems (Mac OS X and various Berkeley Software Distributions (BSDs) implement this interface); however, making use of this requires re-compiling for each platform. A compatible API, on the other hand, allows compiled object code to function without any changes, on any system implementing that API. This is beneficial to both software providers (where they may distribute existing software on new systems without producing/distributing upgrades) and users (where they may install older software on their new systems without purchasing upgrades), although this generally requires various software libraries implementing the necessary APIs too.\nMicrosoft has shown significant commitment to a backward compatible API, particularly within their Windows API (Win32) library, such that older applications may run on newer versions of Windows. Apple Inc. has shown less propensity to this concern, breaking compatibility or implementing an API in a slower \"emulation mode\"; this allows greater freedom in development, at the cost of making older software obsolete.\nAmong Unix-like operating systems, there are many related but incompatible operating systems running on a common hardware platform (particularly Intel 80386-compatible systems). There have been several attempts to standardise the API such that software vendors may distribute one binary application for all these systems; however to date, none of these have met with much success. The Linux Standard Base is attempting to do this for the Linux platform, while many of the BSD Unices (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD) implement various levels of API compatibility for both backward compatibility (allowing programs written for older versions to run on newer distributions of the system) and cross-platform compatibility (allowing execution of foreign code without recompiling).\nRelease policies\nCommon API publishing policies include:\nCompanies do not release API information to anybody outside of the company.\nCompanies protect information on their APIs from the general public. For example, Sony used to make its official PlayStation 2"
"ates, have access not only to such signals, but also to prior experience of other group members. Whether this experience affects how animals interpret reproductive signals is unknown. Here, we explore whether familiarity with a specific female affects a male's ability to assess that female's reproductive signals. We used a preferential looking procedure to assess signal discrimination in free-ranging rhesus macaques, a species in which female facial luminance covaries with reproductive status. We collected images of female faces throughout the reproductive cycle, and using faecal hormone analysis to determine ovulation, categorized images as coming from a female's pre-fertile, ovulating, or post-fertile period. Weprinted colour-calibrated stimuli of these faces, reproducing stimuli perceptually the same in colour and luminance to the original appearance of females. These images were presented to males who were either unfamiliar or familiar with stimuli females. Overall, males distinguished ovulatory from pre-ovulatory faces. However, a significant proportion of males did so only among males familiar with stimuli females. These experiments demonstrate that familiarity may increase a receiver's ability to use a social partner's signals to discern their reproductive status. \u00a9 2011 the Royal Society.\nSpottiswoode CN, Stevens M (2011). How to evade a coevolving brood parasite: egg discrimination versus egg variability as host defences. Proc Biol Sci, 278(1724), 3566-3573.\nHow to evade a coevolving brood parasite: egg discrimination versus egg variability as host defences.\nArms races between avian brood parasites and their hosts often result in parasitic mimicry of host eggs, to evade rejection. Once egg mimicry has evolved, host defences could escalate in two ways: (i) hosts could improve their level of egg discrimination; and (ii) negative frequency-dependent selection could generate increased variation in egg appearance (polymorphism) among individuals. Proficiency in one defence might reduce selection on the other, while a combination of the two should enable successful rejection"

"since the beginning of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the worldwide pandemic, the number of attacks against Asian people based solely on their appearance has increased exponentially. (Research also shows identity-based attacks against Asians are not new and usually go significantly underreported.) In some regions of our country, the increase in anti-Asian crime is nearly 2,000%. In other regions, as one community member explained, \u201cOur seniors are afraid to walk their own streets.\u201d Many of these attacks appear unprovoked, increasingly aggressive, and exceedingly violent. Members of our own university community have been victims of these personal attacks.\nThe use of hateful terms like \u201cChina flu\u201d and \u201ckung flu\u201d has not abated, even with the administration change in Washington, D.C. These slurs make people who appear to be of Asian descent vulnerable to crimes. Children are not immune either. Asian American students have reported taunting, bullying and physical attacks in schools.\nWe state first, and unequivocally, that we condemn these acts of violence and hatred in the strongest of terms. The criminal behavior targeting Asians cannot be tolerated in a civil society, nor will it be tolerated on our campus.\nTo our Asian community members who have experienced hateful acts such as these, we want you to know we hear you, we see you, we believe you, and we support you.

"2023 \u00b7 All Rights Reserved \u00b7 London Sewers & London's Main Drainage | sub-urban.com<s> In Celebration of Labor\nThe bumper sticker read, \"I owe. I owe. It's off to work I go.\" Well, that's what many -- including many Christians -- think of work. Find out about the goodness of work. What does Labor Day mean? For most of us, it's nothing more than a welcome break from what we tend to see as \"the daily grind.\" Work to so many people is simply a necessary evil. The goal in life is putting in enough time to retire and relax. But that attitude and that goal is contrary to a Christian worldview perspective on work. Christians have a special reason to celebrate Labor Day, which honors the fundamental dignity of workers, because we worship a God Who labored to make the world\u2014and Who created human beings in His image to be His workers. When God made Adam and Eve, He gave them work to do: cultivating and caring for the earth. In the ancient world, the Greeks and Romans looked upon manual work as a curse, something for lower classes and slaves. But Christianity changed all of that. Christians viewed work as a high calling\u2014a calling to be co-workers with God in unfolding the rich potential of His creation. This high view of work can be traced throughout the history of the Church. In the Middle Ages, the guild movement grew out of the Church. It set standards for good workmanship and encouraged members to take satisfaction in the results of their labor. The guilds became the forerunner of the modern labor movement. Later, during the Reformation, Martin Luther preached that all work should be done to the glory of God. Whether ministering the Gospel or scrubbing floors, any honest work is pleasing to the Lord. Out of this conviction grew the Protestant work ethic. Christians were also active on behalf of workers in the early days of the industrial revolution, when factories were \"dark satanic mills,\" to borrow a phrase from Sir William Blake. In those days, work in factories and coal mines was hard and dangerous. Men, women, and children were practically slaves\u2014sometimes even chained to machines. Then John Wesley came preaching and teaching"

Thus, as part of their vigorous defense of Tebow, his most ardent fans on Fox's \"The Five\" attacked not only Bill Maher, who had the audacity to send an irreverent tweet about Tebow, they also attacked atheists and pro-choicers who are frequent targets of Fox's godly, propagandistic wrath.

"<s> USA Pickleball Junior Spotlight: Maddie Toren\nBy: Hope Tolley \u2013 Published in Pickleball Magazine\nMaddie Toren, 17, of Phoenix, Arizona, is making her mark in the pickleball community both as a player and as a referee. Since being introduced to the sport in 2021, Maddie has played in six tournaments and won gold in 3.0 19+ mixed doubles, become a certified line judge and level one trained referee, and reached more than 600K views on her pickleball-related TikTok videos.\nMaddie first started playing pickleball in February, 2021, when she was introduced to the sport by her uncle. Her initial experience of playing pickleball led her to further explore the sport. As her family\u2019s interest grew, they invested in equipment, learned the rules, put a portable net in their garage and have plans to purchase an RV to travel to tournaments throughout the year.\nAfter playing for only a few months, Maddie was falling in love with the sport and the community. She worked with her local pros, Ryan Trefry and Dave Furman, which led to new skills and improved abilities. In May of 2021, Maddie entered her first tournament at the National Pickleball Celebrity Tanning Open playing 3.0 19+ doubles with her mom, Crystal, and mixed doubles with her dad, Adam. She and her mom finished one game away from the medal matches, and she and her dad won gold in their bracket. After that tournament, Maddie was determined to learn more and improve her game by drilling, watching YouTube and Pickleball 360 videos, and pushing herself by playing with skilled players.\nIn addition to playing pickleball, Maddie has become a certified level one referee. Based on guidance from her regional referee trainers, she took an online refereeing course. She was also introduced to Leslie Shaunessy, a referee from Gilbert, Arizona, who was able to guide Maddie through the process to become a referee, which included self-study, online tests, an eye exam, and becoming a certified line judge. Following that, she shadowed referee Bill"

"\"[Wilson] reports himself that officials in Niger said that Iraq was seeking to contact officials in Niger about sales\". That's consistent with Tenet. So he's got a text that keeps saying \"former offical\" and he ad libs an explanation of the term -- incorrectly at first and then rights himself.\nantiaristo\nIsn't the reason for the assumption that it is not Libby that Novak says he is \"no partisan gunslinger\"? I myself think there are two ways to parse that phrase (http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/10/20/264/24229).\nAgain, good comments. I'm still trying to piece together when their narratives changed and when. I actually think at least as likely that they had two different narratives, depending on how trustworthy the journalist was perceived to be. So Cooper, Pincus, and a few others get the CIA employ but not the NOC. Novak (and probably Judy, even if she doesn't tell us about it) get the NOC. Which might also suggest that Ari was told to leak one thing, and more trustworthy leakers (Rove and Libby and ?) were told to leak another. Reviewing Cooper's first story on this, it does appear that he got the \"emphasize Tenet\" line, rather than the Ari line (if it is different, which I agree it may not be):\nA source close to the matter says that Wilson was dispatched to Niger because Vice President Dick Cheney had questions about an intelligence report about Iraq seeking uranium and that he asked that the CIA get back to him with answers. Cheney's staff has adamantly denied and Tenet has reinforced the claim that the Vice President had anything to do with initiating the Wilson mission. They say the Vice President merely asked routine questions at an intelligence briefing and that mid-level CIA officials, on their own, chose to dispatch Wilson.\nWilson tells the story differently and in a crucial respect. He says the official in question was contacted by an Algerian-Nigerien intermediary who inquired if the official would meet with an Iraqi about \"commercial\" sales \u2014 an offer he declined. Wilson dismisses CIA Director George Tenet's suggestion"

Although this was the right change to make, they were using the same cache-control header to control how long the content is stored in Fastly and how long it\u2019s stored in the browser. Because their content is very static, they can actually tell Fastly to cache content infinitely because they purge the cache as part of their deploy. On the other hand, they want to refresh the browser every 2-4 hours, but requests will hit Fastly, not the origin.\nThey use the Fastly surrogate-control header to pull which cache-control header they\u2019re listening to. They send the cache-control header to the browser and set it to 4 hours, and set the surrogate-control header to a week \u2014 Fastly will hold static site data in memory for about a week, and will gradually fall out. That way, if \u201csomeone has an outage that lasts longer than a week\u201d they\u2019ll have other opportunities to recover.\nThey also added two \u201csuper important\u201d headers, stale-if-error and stale-while-revalidate.

Crime rates have been falling across the country for the last 30 years \u2014 it\u2019s statistically the safest era to be an American.

"be independent of the nerve compression itself.\nYeah. And I think this is something we will probably explore in a little bit greater detail when we have that conversation with Stuart McGill here, coming up too, because this is certainly his realm. I've heard him talk a number of times about this in terms of the necessity of teaching people about more optimal movement patterns that really can alleviate a lot of pain. Like when you have a certain type of thing with your back that causes sciatic pain shooting down your leg, or whatever, every time you lean over the sink to brush your teeth. And then that just perpetuates into, I know when I try to lean over to do something else, this is going to hurt. And that whole sensitization thing gets really out of whack. There's a lot of things that I think we can play a part in, in terms of turning that around, but people have to remember this generally doesn't happen quickly. There's oftentimes going to be a little bit more time involved with making it occur or making it happen.\nWell. Yeah. I can't wait to hear what he says about his sniff and his different kinds of things he does to help people stabilize in his model, around the nerve, but then for me, teasing it apart from... My goal is to help people with their pain, of course. That's what they want, too, but it doesn't always happen right away. Even if I've done the tissue part, that there's still a neurological part, often. The nerve is still, or the brain is still sensitized. And that oftentimes that takes a little more time, just time for the body to adjust.\nAnd then on the other hand there's times when that doesn't seem to go away, honestly. As confident as I am in my treatments and as much as I would like to say, this is an effective approach, which it is, there's times it just doesn't seem to go away. And sometimes helping people think about it in terms of sensitivity or irritation more than a compression, can be a more helpful reframe, can be a way to realize your nerve is sensitized, it's irritated, so it hurts.

QC standards were as follows: (1) removing reads with \u2265 10% unidentified nucleotides (N); (2) removing reads with >\u200950% bases having a phred quality <\u20095; (3) removing reads with >\u200910\u2009nt aligned to the adapter, allowing \u2264 10% mismatches; and (4) removing putative PCR duplicates generated in the library construction process.\nAfter trimming low-quality bases, paired-end reads of each population were mapped to our field pennycress reference genome using BWA-mem (v. 0.7.17) [58] with parameters of mem -t 4 -k 32 -M -R. Ambiguously mapped reads were removed. Alignment files were converted to BAM files using the SAMtools v0.1.18 software [73]. Variant calling was performed for all samples using the UnifiedGenotyper function in GATK software [74]. SNPs used the VariantFiltration parameter in GATK (settings: --filterExpression \u201cQD < 4.0 || FS > 60.0 || MQ < 40.0\u201d, -G_filter \u201cGQ<20\u201d, --clusterWindowSize 4). AN"

Roth conversions increase your taxable income in addition to your SS, pension, taxable withdrawals etc. If you want to stay within the 12% bracket and not have additional dollars above that taxed at 22% you will need to closely estimate your taxes for the year before performing the conversion.\nI searched the web and it appears that OK has an income tax. The Roth conversion will be subject to tax.\nFiveK\nPost by FiveK \u00bb Mon Jan 23, 2023 7:04 am\nMaybe. Might be 12% or maybe 27% (see the chart in the Marginal tax rate - Bogleheads wiki for that situation) or maybe something else. Depends on your specific situation. Using one or more tax estimation tools may be useful.\nDon't know details of OK taxes.

However there isn't an easy way to get a nationwide view of the data. BuildingEye, an independent SME, built http://mypp.ie/ to achieve this. However as each local authority didn't have an Open Data portal, BuildingEye had to directly ask each local authority for its data. It was granted access to some authorities, but not all.

"the dump.\"\n\"Aw, you flatlanders are all alike,\" he said. \"Always bearanoid!\" Jim was silhouetted against the waxing moonlight in the southern sky.\n\"How was the fishing?\" I said.\nJim nodded his head slowly and deliberately. He said, \"Hey--we gotta get some more of those things!\"\nMaking Roadkills\nThe fly I have developed for this kind of fishing is a fur strip from 2\" to 8\" long, with any #6 short-shank hook threaded through three holes in the middle of the fly. I used to place the hook near the rear end. But it turns out trout (at least) attack bait fish \"near the center of gravity\" of the prey. In other words they tend to bite bait fish right behind the shoulders of the gills. I doubt a roadkill looks like a baitfish. But I do get fewer missed strikes with the hook mounted at mid-strip.\nTo the eye of the hook I attach an eight to fifteen pound-test shock tippet with an improved clinch knot. Then I poke a hole in the fur strip half-way between the eye of the hook andthe front end of the fur. I thread the shock tippet thought the hole in the middle of the fur strip, and then throw an overhand clinch knot around the front end of the fly.This fly can be tied in your hands, without thread or the aid of a fly tying vise. I carry a box of hooks and a hunk of fur in my tackle box, and never have to worry about running out of flies.\nBecause the bulk of the fly is tied around a flexible piece of monofilament, a Roadkill Streamer swims and corkscrews through the water with a more lively and critter-like fashion than a fly that is tied on a straight-shank hook. More complex patterns are also possible. Additional clinch knots with the monofilament shock tippet, or fly tying thread and a thread bobbin can be used to add yarn, flashabou, hackle or chain-bean embellishments to the front end of the fly. Double fur strips can be used to create a two-tone fly.<s> Hi My account"

It had come to the light from wherever spiders make their abodes, whether from within the walls of the house or from the surrounding florae, hitching a ride on an unsuspecting person or pet. Spiders in general do not bother me, but I cannot say the same for the other residents of my home. In one respect, I had the power over whether it lived or died and I stand by my decision.\nPrior to my decision, I held an impromptu conversation with the arachnid, generally as follows:\nIf you had just remained where you were before the light came on, I would not have to kill you. If you were a butterfly or a ladybug, something pleasing to me and all, I would gently carry you away to a place of safety. How much better for you if you had never been born at all, let alone as a spider. But again, you had no choice in the matter; you are what you are. It was then, the epiphany pinged my brain.\nJust Like In the Cartoons ... a Light Came On.\nI get these on occasions and when they keep hanging on, I run with it wherever it may lead.\nThe Light of the Word exposes the sins that lie in the darkness of men\u2019s souls.

"have a great PC or console game, but will it be similarly impressive on a smaller screen? Will it be possible to play the game on a mobile device? To optimize your game for mobile, consider the user interface of the device and how to adapt in-game controls so the user can play the game on a smaller screen using touch controls (in most cases). Here are some examples of areas to focus:\nFor example, an in-game armor shop with many tabs and details for each item works well on larger screens. However, such an interface could be too cluttered with unreadable small text and buttons on a smartphone.\nAny interface should be easily accessible, easy to read, and adapted to the touch screen controls. If you haven\u2019t built a mobile interface before, one way to learn about what works is to check out the genre leaders\u200a\u2014\u200athe top 3 or 5 mobile games in the same genre as your game.\nWhen thinking about the UI, you should also remember the controls. While it is possible to use a dedicated gaming controller to play a game on mobile, very few users will play the game this way: most players use their device\u2019s touchscreen. This means you must adopt the touchscreen navigation and make sure the game is easy and fun to play with that control method.\nTo keep your loyal community healthy and happy, make sure to protect your title from modifications. Google provides solutions to help avoid possible abuse, while securing your business and taking care of your users.\nSome tools that could help you to protect your IP on Google Play include:\nApp integrity automatically adds runtime integrity checks with each release to reduce unauthorized modification or redistribution for games published with the Android App Bundle. This tool protects games that are not intrinsically server-based from tampering, and are especially suitable for premium games, single-player games, and games with offline components.\nApp licensing determines whether a binary can be trusted by verifying that the APK came from the Play Store. For example, prevent piracy or reduce beta leakage when soft-launching in several countries.\nSafetyNet Attestation API is an anti-abuse API that assesses the Android device your app is running on. The API should be used as a part of your abuse detection system to help determine whether your servers are interacting with a genuine copy of your app running on"

The New York Mets announced Friday evening that the club has signed All-Star appropriate-handed pitcher David Robertson to a 1-year contract. Faced with the departure of ace Jacob deGrom to the Rangers for a five-year, $185M contract, the Mets acted promptly to replace him with AL Cy Young champ Justin Verlander on a two-year, $86.7M deal.\nHowever, adding a catcher this late in the season is not frequent, given how difficult it is for mentioned player to learn a new pitching employees on the fly.

PubMed #23804342 \u2750 PainSci #53484 \u2750\nOBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the iliotibial band (ITB) moves relative to the lateral femoral epicondyle (LFE) as a function of knee flexion in both non-weight-bearing and weight-bearing positions in asymptomatic recreational runners.\nMETHODS: Five male and 15 female asymptomatic recreational runners (10-30 miles/wk) aged 18 to 40 years were examined with sonography to assess the distance between the anterior fibers of the ITB and the LFE in full extension, 30\u00b0 of knee flexion, and 45\u00b0 of knee flexion. Measurements were obtained on both knees in the supine (non-weight-bearing) and standing (weight-bearing) positions.\nRESULTS: The distance between the anterior fibers of the ITB and the LFE decreased significantly from full extension to 45\u00b0 of knee flexion in both supine (0.38-cm average decrease; P < .001) and standing (0.71-cm average decrease; P < .001) positions. These changes reflect posterior translation of the ITB during the 0\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 flexion arc of motion in both the supine and standing positions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Sonographic evaluation of the ITB in our study population clearly revealed anteroposterior motion of the ITB relative to the LFE during knee flexion-extension.

Who made \"la ronda\"?\nThe Royal Cors of Coast Policemen and Spanish Frontiers was the armed corps created in 1829 with the aim to monitor the coast and the frontiers to prevent fraud and smuggling. The functions of this corps were assumed by the Spanish Military Guards from 1940 on, since during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), the policemen were for the republican government.\nSMUGGLING and STRAPERLO What is it? What products were used in smuggling and straperlo?\nSmuggling is the ilegal trading of goods, consisting of carrying forbidden products by hiding them, skipping custom charges.\nStraperlo consists of the ilegal sell of smugling goods or the fraudulent sell of products in the own country that are subject to taxes and duties. This fact has prompted the usage of the word straperlo as synonym to black market.\nBlond tobacco was the main product affected by smuggling and straperlo (mainly of the brands Philip Morris, Pall Mall, Lucky, Chesterfield and Winston), but there were also other products such as penicillin, coffee, sugar, pepper, chocolate and other minor goods such as makeup sets, shimmer powder, lingerie, jewelry and silk clothes.\nHOW WAS SMUGGLING ORGANIZED AND HOW DID SMUGGLERS WORK?\nDuring sunset or at night, large draught ships that made international routes approached the Costa Brava seaside and, without docking at any port, but decreasing the speed, downloaded the goods with small fishermen ships that did hide rapidly in small corners of the abrupt Costa Brava.\nNext,"

This expansion causes the mechanical stress in the membrane to decrease, which results in a reduction in resonance frequency, like in a guitar string.\nThe new measurement concept is applicable to a wide variety of thin membrane systems with different phase transitions, as the researchers demonstrate by observing charge density wave ordering in TaS2. \u201cFor this reason, we believe that our concept has the potential to be applied to study a large range of materials: 2D ferromagnets, thin 2D complex oxide sheets and organic antiferromagnets,\u201d \u0160i\u0161kins says. \u201dWe expect this will lead to a better understanding of thermodynamics and ordering mechanisms in two-dimensional materials.\u201d\nReference: \u201cMagnetic and electronic phase transitions probed by nanomechanical resonators\u201d by Makars \u0160i\u0161kins, Martin Lee, Samuel Ma\u00f1as-Valero, Eugenio Coronado, Yaroslav M.

"it's perhaps easiest to just leave it that way. If it's trivial to add it, why not just add it? --Mwtalbert 00:47, 5 March 2009 (UTC)\nTo my knowledge, there is only one module using GIFs, and it's not CrossWire content. Material in GIFs can be bulk converted to PNGs. The only officially supported image file format is JPEG (although the first image test module actually consisted of BMPs). I think it's very reasonable to expand that to include PNGs, since they are useful in a variety of circumstances where JPEG is an inferior choice. But I can't see anything that GIF offers that PNG doesn't do better. --Osk 03:04, 5 March 2009 (UTC)\nI think there is one argument I can see for (whatever not officially supported) image format - and that is copyright restrictions. Stuff like \"distribute at will, but do not change in any form or way\". Having said this I have not come across this wrt image formats and would consider a limitation of formats which ensures that all frontends can make equal use of it is a useful thing. What might be worthwhile though - and that goes way beyond this particular comparison page is a test module with every semi-relevant image format under the sun thrown in and then we could map which frontends (and not just the PC/Mac) ones can deal with them. It is clear that Webkit and Xul derrived fronends are pretty limitless in their support, while others might be a lot more restricted. It would be good to know. refdoc:talk\nOsk, this is a strong statement, even though I agree with it. I think that our \"module making\" guide should be explicit in stating \"Only use jpeg now and after 1.5.12, you can also use png. Using any other kind of image will result in a module that cannot be used in one or more SWORD applications. Submission of a module with other image formats will hinder its acceptance into the CrossWire repository as such images will need to be converted into a supported format.\"--Dmsmith 13:11, 5 March 2009 (UTC)\nBp"

Watch them perform The Bad Seeds\u2019 \u2018We No Who U R\u2019 below.\nREAD MORE: Nick Cave & Warren Ellis live in London: Minimal elements for maximum impact\nJoining Cave and Ellis for the second encore of the night, Flea helped them perform the opening track to The Bad Seeds\u2019 2012 album, \u2018Push The Sky Away\u2019. This was the song\u2019s debut on the pair\u2019s current tour for their acclaimed 2021 album \u2018CARNAGE\u2019, and the first time that the song has been played in seven years.\nThe bassist added his own meandering style to the track, before embracing Cave and Ellis at the end of the song.\nAfter the concert, Ellis took to Instagram to share a photo of the two, writing \u201cFlea, beautiful brother.

"rips and Indonesia can't get enough of Bali\n53 per cent travellers said they are very likely to explore offbeat domestic destinations. Roadtrips still continue to be a big hit among Indians\nThe past two years have been a roller coaster. But it has also been a great show of vigour and resilience - be it fighting at the frontlines, fast-paced inoculation drives, or the confidence to step out and explore mother nature. It\u2019s clear that if there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s on people\u2019s minds, the rising and ebbing tide of Covid notwithstanding, it\u2019s travel.\nAs soon as the world opened up, travellers hit the roads and took to the skies. And no, we\u2019re not just saying this by intuition or what we\u2019ve been seeing on our late night Instagram scrolls! OYO has conducted a consumer survey to study travel intent and expectations among its user base across some of its core markets, including India, Indonesia and Europe; bringing to you OYO\u2019s fourth year-end annual index - \u2018OYO Travelopedia 2021\u2019.\nFrom workcations dominating 2021, to exploring domestic offbeat destinations, to doom scrolling on Instagram and travelling more in 2022, the report maps how consumers travelled in 2021 and their resolutions for 2022.\n2020 was a tough year. Families and friends were unable to meet each other for birthdays and milestones, students couldn\u2019t travel back home for festive celebrations, and friends shared dinners over video calls. But 2021 was somewhat different.\nAccording to OYO Travelopedia, nearly 65 per cent of respondents have travelled in the past 6 months and a majority of them visited their loved ones. Some also needed a getaway from their daily routines and travelled for leisure. A few had to keep the economy going and they travelled for business needs.\nIndia is a resilient country - and with mass vaccination drives, travel intent and confidence is back! 60 per cent of respondents have planned vacations for the winter holiday season.

"Russell Dauterman and Matthew Wilson hit all of their deadlines and released all six issues of War Of The Realms on the date it was announced in Marvel\u2019s monthly solicitation. Not only that, they were able to do this without having to rely on someone else to step in to help. All six issues of War Of The Realms were done by Aaron, Dauterman and Wilson.\nMaking this even more impressive is that Aaron, Dauterman and Wilson released all six issues of War Of The Realms between April and June. That is a rate of two issues a month over the course of three months. That is a release schedule that fans never expect from a big event. These type of stories are expected to be released once a month, especially when only one art team was working on the series. Now with War Of The Realms the team of Aaron, Dauterman and Wilson have set the benchmark of the quality and release schedule every creative team behind a big event from Marvel and DC Comics need to follow.\nCONTINUATION OF JASON AARON\u2019S EPIC THOR RUN\nWhen it came to War Of The Realms it was just another chapter in the grand epic that Jason Aaron has been working on since he first started his Thor run. That is something that was blatantly clear in every issue for War Of The Realms. For fans of this run War Of The Realms did read like a major payoff for everything Aaron has been building. It was the story that has been built and allows the natural progression of the Thor Odinson to continue walking down.\nAt the same time, even if you have not read Aaron\u2019s Thor run yet War Of The Realms was not inaccessible. Personally, I have only read about half of Aaron\u2019s run on Thor, so I only really understood some of the references to past stories during this period. But even then Aaron never made it feel as though because you are not caught up on his Thor work that you should not read War Of The Realms.\nAaron welcomed new readers in smartly by how he used the rest of the heroes in the Marvel Universe. Just like the reader, the Avengers, X-Men, Champions, Defenders and all the other non-Thor related heroes were thrust into this event and catch up with what is going as War Of The Realms developed.

"elight magazine, and on Arts Professional, and an article from the Latin Mass Society (of which James MacMillan, a signatory below, is a patron), focusing in particular on Gill\u2019s comparison of reading music to learning Latin. Another recent blog article considers the article in the context of changing expectations in UK secondary education, while composer and teacher Des Oliver has made an important podcast with Tigran Arakelyan about the article, and I have also made an extended podcast with Arakelyan, considering the article and wider issues of musical education, notation, literacy, privilege, and more.\nFor an utterly contrasting view to that of Gill, strongly advocating reading (and sight reading), composition, and musical history, being available to all schoolchildren by right, see this 1945 pamphlet by the Workers\u2019 Music Association (hardly the voice of the wealthy), especially pages 5-6. Speaking personally, I think many of the recommendations in this pamphlet are as relevant now as they were 72 years ago. I have also blogged an inspiring defence of the teaching of Western classical music and literacy by Estelle R. Jorgensen, which I believe to be highly relevant to this debate.\nI will happily add other names to the list: if you wish to be added, please post underneath with your name and how you would like to be described.\n[Earlier addendum material on related subjects is included at the bottom of this post \u2013 this and the above constitute my own thoughts, not those of the signatories]\nCharlotte C.

This claim flies in the face of countless initiatives over two centuries making musical literacy available to those of many backgrounds.

"of the 2015 season. How many of the Packers' new draft picks do you think will get playing time in regular season games this year, and who might they be?\nKenny Clark and Blake Martinez appear to have solid opportunities to log playing time. Kyler Fackrell is a pass rusher and there's always room for pass rushers. I don't want to see Jason Spriggs forced to do what David Bakhtiari did in 2013, but injuries are a fact of life on the offensive line and Spriggs will likely log playing time if he can position himself as a rookie. Dean Lowry might have a chance right from the start, as the Packers will likely need a rotation of defensive linemen to deal with the heat in Jacksonville. Trevor Davis is a speed receiver. He'll have an opportunity to stretch the field and return kicks. Kyle Murphy appears to be a \"jar on the shelf\" type of player, but you never know. At close examination, the draft class appears to have the opportunity to be immediate contributors, but I don't think that's a fair expectation. Let's make sure we give them time to grow.\nRichard from Madison, WI\nYou've often spoken in glowing terms of Tony Boselli. I've heard the Bengals' Anthony Munoz referred to as the greatest offensive tackle ever. Could you compare the two?

At this point, Riley\u2019s biggest struggle in life is protecting Carly from the unscrupulous wealthy elite kids in her \u201cFirefly Troop\u201d (a stand-in for the Girl Scouts), competing for the best spot to sell cookies in front of the local grocery store and assuring her daughter that to stoop to their level is to lose.\nBut that sentiment quickly goes out the window when she loses Chris and Carly to a drive-by shooting. It wasn\u2019t a totally random act of violence \u2014 Chris was being recruited to rob a local drug kingpin named Diego Garcia (Juan Pablo Raba),"

"new language into the budget. They got caught trying to gut the state\u2019s open records law and had to reverse that move. But so far, Walker and his allies have gotten almost no pushback on another terrible maneuver: eliminating language defining the state\u2019s 100-year-old \u201cliving wage.\u201d\nWisconsin law now says employers must pay a \u201cliving wage,\u201d defined as pay that offers \u201cminimum comfort, decency, physical and moral well-being.\u201d Walker has long insisted the state\u2019s $7.25 an hour minimum wage is the same as a \u201cliving wage\u201d; workers have sued to challenge that definition. If the state strikes the language that defines living wage more broadly, that will cut the legs out from under such legal challenges.\nOne of the plaintiffs in that suit, fast food worker and activist Cornell White, talked to Think Progress about the sneaky move. \u201cI am a hard working man. It\u2019s disgusting that these Republicans would rather force me to feed my son with food stamps instead of standing up to their corporate lobbyist friends.\u201d\nWhite scoffs at Walker\u2019s claim that $7.25 an hour is livable: \u201cThey clearly they don\u2019t believe their own argument since they are trying to repeal the law before they even know the outcome of the case.\u201d\nBut the living wage and open records moves weren\u2019t the only shameful additions to the budget over the weekend.

In 1991, Ficalora's father was murdered outside a local subway station. In 2011, his mother died of a brain tumor. In his effort to revive himself, Ficalora was determined to revive his neighborhood. The Bushwick Collective is the astonishing result of his personal fight to erase his painful memories, as he transformed his neighborhood into an incredible open-air gallery.

If homosexuality is regarded as a sort of birth defect like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy that parents wish not to occur in offspring anymore.\nBTW, my advocacy on reallocating medical dollars society dishes out is a personal preference for loud-mouthed little gays like you to shut up and focus on figuring out how to bugger one another without spreading disease and expecting the rest of us to pay for you and the drug users....Instead of the multibillions disbursed \"non-means tested\" free AIDs care to sometimes quite wealthy gays - a very disproportionate share of medical care dollars. Or of gov't R&D dollars that go into AIDs research rather than far more widespread afflictions that kill far more people.

Who better than a good cop like Poole, and who better to bring his story to life than an actor like Depp, who can pretty much do anything but tries something we\u2019re not used to seeing from him everyday: play a regular guy just trying to do the right thing in the face of absolute corruption.\nTagged Biggie Smalls, Brad Furman, Christopher Wallace, cinema, City Of Lies, Dayton Callie, film, film review, film reviews, films, Forest Whitaker, Johnny Depp, Kevin Chapman, lapd, Laurence Mason, Los Angeles, Louis Herthum, Michael pare, movie, movie review, movie reviews, Movies, Notorious BIG, obba babatunde, peter greene, Rockmund Dunbar, Russell Poole, shea wigham, Thriller, Toby Huss, Tupac Shakur, Voletta Love, Xander BerkeleyLeave a comment<s> Gazette.govt.nz\nSearch all notices:\nFind a specific notice:\nYear 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 "

"the white claws which reared up above the shoals be4side me. Even when I was beyond these shoals and rounding the point I kept looking back over my shoulder to see if any monster was going to come up silently behind me.\nI finally crossed into quieter waters but was now facing a force six wind against me and it was getting late at around 2130. I slowly pulled myself up to the abandoned hamlet of Ytre Fure with two well kept houses high above the rocks. There was no place to land here despite the fact the swell was now virtually irrelevant again as the shoals had passed through took their force.\nLooking at the GPS map I could see there was a kind of breakwater some 2 km east along the coast into this strong force 6 wind. With the light starting to fade I decided to aim for this breakwater at the hamlet of Indre Fure. As I paddled up the rocky coast I saw nowhere to land at all. Progress was slow due to the wind and I was having to dig deep and strain my sinews to move up the coast. Eventually I was the breakwater and pulled round it.\nI have occasionally had some surprises when figuring out places to stay from the map. Nothing quite matched Indre Fure. Here on the other side of this small breakwater was a beautiful white beach. Above the beach was a cluster of very nice buildings and houses in a green landscape. The houses were all surrounded with masses of plants and flowers, especially roses which were all in full bloom. It was an exceptionally idyllic sight. It was as if I had walked through a wardrobe door into a different world.\nI landed the kayak on the beach and found a nice camp spot just above it. There was no one around and I put up the tent. I was now after 2200 and the last light of the day was just lingering. A lady appeared from the nicest house and I went over to explain. She and her husband were one of three families who lived here. Like many small places in Norway they had the same surname of the hamlet. They were Kjell and Marit Fure. I chatted with her for 10 minutes until it the drizzle and wind drove her in again and I went to the tent. I crashed out straight away"

"then the Nubert nuLine 244 is the best proof.\nAt first, one is actually speechless when the first bars sound about the Nubert nuLine 244, because it is remarkable that such a tiny floorstanding loudspeaker system can make such an impressive impression.\nSo it delivers \u2013 and this is really astonishing \u2013 not only a solid, but actually powerful and at the same time astonishingly precise reproduction in the bass range. Of course, this depends first and foremost on the appropriate electronics, no question about that, but with the right playing partner \u2013 in our case the Nubert nuConnect ampX \u2013 it delivers powerful and dynamic, rousing sound. Vocals are also presented in a credible, natural way and with all nuances, to which the finely reproduced high frequency range contributes a good deal, especially with female voices. It is not surprising that instruments can also unfold their full splendour, which is especially noticeable in smaller instrumentations. When it comes to the reproduction of the often quoted sound stage, it must be noted that it is built up broadly in front of the listener and is presented in a credible way.\nOf course, all this applies within the scope of what this speaker system is designed for. The Nubert nuLine 244 feels comfortable in a typical living room with a surface area of about 15 m2. Here it can really play big, and much bigger than its actual dimensions would suggest.\nIn principle, with such compact systems it is said that an additional subwoofer does no harm, and in fact this is also the case with the Nubert nuLine 244 when the room is a bit larger. In smaller rooms, on the other hand, one might even suspect a subwoofer due to the concise bass performance, even if there is none in play.\nThe Nubert nuLine 224 is an extremely slim, and therefore very easy and ultimately harmonious, stand speaker system that can be integrated into any living space, and which offers a remarkable performance, especially in view of its very, very compact dimensions. A solid, clean bass, natural mid-range and finely presented trebles are as much a feature of their performance as is their wide dispersion into the room. The only thing that is needed is a high-quality electronic system that can be added"

TNC over-expression is repeatedly observed in several cancer tissues and promotes several processes in tumor progression. Until quite recently, more needs to be known about the potential mechanisms of TNC as a key player in cancer progression and metastasis. Materials and Methods: In the present study, we performed a bioinformatics analysis of breast and colorectal cancer expression microarray data to survey TNC role and function with holistic view. Gene expression profiles were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal samples and cancer biopsy samples. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of the DEGs with CluePedia plugin of Cytoscape software were constructed. Furthermore, after PPI network construction, gene-regulatory networks analysis was performed to predict long noncoding RNAs and microRNAs associated with TNC and cluster analysis was performed. Using the Clue gene ontology (GO) plugin of Cytoscape software, the GO and pathway enrichment analysis were performed. Results: PPI and DEGs-miRNA-lncRNA regulatory networks showed TNC is a significant node in a huge network, and one of the main gene with high centrality parameters. Furthermore, from the regulatory level perspective"

It means a place that can redo your car\u2019s paint job.\nA variation on the baked cat is the open cat (creative Indonesian spelling at its best). And what could the Poles Body be all about? The mind boggles.\nGang \u2013 why are there so many gangs in Bali? They even have their own sign posts. Gang means small street.\nGot \u2013 we have one of these across from our house.

"bells? Gary Cziko makes the case that it is analogous to evolution by natural selection in his book Without Miracles. This case is expanded in wonderful detail in a chapter in Dawkins & Ridley\u2019s \u2018Oxford Surveys in Evolutionary Biology\u2019 by Ted Cloak. The same author has updated his work in an video-supported online article that provides a mechanism for cultural evolution through what has been termed the \u2018meme\u2019 (Dawkins, 1976).\nThere is an emerging view that evolution is essentially a process of negative feedback control. An even more radical and exciting perspective informed by PCT is that because organisms are partly responsible for driving their own direction of evolution \u2013 \u2018evolution on purpose\u2019 (Corning, 2013). Powers himself wrote a compelling case for the origin of life as the emergence of control within chains of biochemicals.\nWarren Mansell makes the case for the links between Darwin\u2019s approach to evolution and the approach of PCT to psychology in a recent talk:https://www.youtube.com/embed/vQ3lY1U60MM\nIt is one thing to say that PCT is analogous to processes in biology. In the book Behavior: The Control of Perception Bill suggests that it is more than simply an analogy. He explains how neurones can be arranged to operate as control systems. The above illustration taken from Behaviour: The Control of Perception provides one example. Powers (1999) describes a computer model of arm movement that illustrates the physiological and physical basis of PCT. This model has been updated and available to download on Bill Powers\u2019 home page. Interestingly, Powers\u2019 description of the physiological basis of PCT resonates with early work of John Hughlings Jackson and Nikolai Bernstein. As such, to some extent, it converges with contemporary work on the equilibrium point hypothesis. A 1973 paper by Martin Taylor on tactile perception also showed some convergence with Powers\u2019 ideas.\nPCT proposes that many systems operating continuously and in parallel \u2013 this fits with how the nervous system is arranged. We also know that there are just as many nerve signals going upstream from senses (afferent pathways) to higher centres of the brain as there are going in"

"1497 Anne of Brittany, Queen of France, gives birth to a son. Within hours the child joins the five dead siblings who came before him. In the mournful weeks that follow, fifteen-year-old Nicole St. Sylvain meets Philippe de Bois, a young horse trainer. The attraction between the two is immediate, but duty and honor bring their romance to an abrupt halt. They work together to heal the horse\u2019s infected hoof, then part ways.\u2019\nThus begins a romance and an interesting novel about a little-known French queen.\nThe story is of Anne\u2019s struggle to produce a family, and her grief at losing her children, a grief shared by so many women throughout history, and continuing to this day. Alongside her is Nicole, the daughter of a wealthy merchant. Her family has money, she is the only heir, but her father is untitled and the nobility is only on the maternal side. Marriage to a noble family would secure her future, but her love is for Philippe. Then the queen\u2019s only child becomes ill and Nicole\u2019s gift of healing is required again. It is a story with a strong sense of place and well-drawn characters, a story of heartache and forbidden love, of women in the 15th century French court, who fought with passion and determination for what they wanted.\nMy one comment would be the uninspiring cover. While using contemporary artwork is a tempting idea, it often does not work when creating something to entice modern readers to look inside.

They've grown accustomed to playing \u2014 and winning \u2014 close games.\nSafeties Julian Love and Xavier McKinney stopped Jacksonville receiver Christian Kirk at the 1-yard line with no time on the clock, preserving a 23-17 victory over the Jaguars in which Saquon Barkley and quarterback Daniel Jones each ran for more than 100 yards.

The Giants' six victories have been by a combined 27 points, with none of those won by more than eight.\nThe latest one was arguably their most improbable considering they lost two starting offensive linemen, including right tackle Evan Neal, and rookie tight end Daniel Bellinger to injuries in the first half.\nBellinger was taken to a hospital with a bloody eye injury.

The American Diabetes Association states that \u201cthere is little evidence of any benefit\u201d to CBD for people with diabetes.\nExperts have speculated that CBD could be beneficial to metabolic conditions such as diabetes and obesity.\nOne reason so few studies have been conducted is the fact that CBD has hovered in a legal gray area for years, making it more difficult to win funding and approvals for medical research. It is now easier to study CBD than ever, and there is more interest than ever, which means we should expect to see better experiments conducted in the coming years.

Radio and TV stations, as well as national and international community media organisations must consider funding, governance structures, changing political and economic conditions, while building, consolidating and extending relationships with their listening communities. The concept of sustainability has been widely used in the context of communication for development paradigms, as a lens for assessing the health and success of that sector. This special issue will provide an opportunity to reflect on questions of resilience and endurance as they arise in alternative, radical, oppositional, and community-grounded media, and to explore the various interdependent factors that can impact the ongoing stability and health of community media projects. Concurrently, the association of the term with questions of ecology prompts a reflective and ethical concern that extends beyond the immediate or parochial, and we expect papers that will, in a holistic fashion, explore the role and operation of the sector in the context of broader socio-political concerns. Community media have been the focus of an increasing amount of scholarly attention as they have grown in size, from social movement theorists, to political economists, to those focused on governance and organisational communication. As Atton and Hamilton (2008: 26) note in their analysis of the political economy of alternative journalism, the \u201cgeneral political-economic dilemma for any critical project is that it needs resources with which to work, but those crucial resources are present only in the very society that it seeks to change or dissolve.\u201d This special issue will build on existing knowledge, together with exploration of contemporary case studies, to explore the"

A recent article on CNBC <www.cnbc.com/id/47340065/page/3/> had comments from the FTC saying that few people file complaints on these schemes and thus they rarely put in the resources to investigate them. There are two reasons why there are so few complaints:\n* People are brainwashed from the beginning that the system \u201cworks\u201d, and \u201cthe only variable is you.\u201d Thus people feel as if it is their own failure rather than recognizing the system was mathematically set up to fail over 99% of people from the beginning. * The FTC doesn\u2019t do anything. You leave a complaint and that\u2019s the end of it. The complainant gets no follow-up from the FTC and there\u2019s never any evidence that the complaint is ever read.

"history and commentary of what was said about the crash, when, and by whom.\nSome Dubious Theses in the Tense Logic of Accidents\nAbstract: Some authors propose to use forms of linear time temporal logic to describe and explain accidents. Common themes are: (1) that the 'original causes' of an accident precede all other relevant events; (2) how to pick the temporal point of view from which the accident can be explained; (3) that it is a criterion of successful explanation that an assertion of the accident event should be logically derivable from assertions of preceding causally-relevant events; (4) that the causal relation is expressed by the tense-logical 'leads to' operator. Some authors have suggested (5) that an accident is explained by exhibiting the proof of the weak fairness of the accident-action. I have explained elsewhere (ad 2) how to pick a temporal point of view, and (ad 4) that causality is not suitably expressed by 'leads to'. I show here that the other three theses are implausible; that (1) may be rescued only at great cost to intuition and common practice; that (3) may be modified in the direction of a deductive-nomological model of explanation; and that (5), if at all worthy, has a much simpler equivalent. (HTML)\nExplaining Failure with Tense Logic\nAbstract: Accidents involve events, and events causing other events, laid out in time until the final disaster. Boolean logic alone is insufficient to describe such failure, although its use in the shape of fault trees has been very successful. Reasoning about objects and their properties is the domain of predicate logic, and reasoning about events and their temporal relations is the province of tense logic. I show how the reasoning involved in accident analysis may be formalised in tense logic, using the past-time operator since. I also show how a fault tree may be derived from a temporal logic description without use of frame axioms. I critique proposals to use purely future operators, and to identify the causality relation with a purely temporal logic operator. Finally, I consider the important concepts of interactive consistency and tight-coupling not to be worth formalising inside a tense logic.

Unfortunately, this fact does not come to light until the morning after Ivan spends the night in Marya's tent.\nWolfe's adjustments to the traditional fairy tale highlight some of the confusing and contradictory elements of the story. The addition of incest, while discomfiting, serves to poke gentle fun at the potential misunderstandings in a tale possessing two characters bearing the same name. It serves, as well, to reference a longstanding element of such behavior in Russian tales, and to explain the otherwise incomprehensible reasoning behind the original Ivan's encounter with Marya Morevna, their brief sojourn and their hasty marriage. In Wolfe's story, it quickly becomes clear that the marriage stems from convenience as much as anything else: neither party is willing to reveal the occurrence of the taboo to world, and the resulting birth of a child (also named Ivan, soon to be known as the Ivan the Simple) negates the possibility of ignoring it entirely.\nIn this story, too, Ivan the Bold frees Koshchei from captivity, but in a far less fancifully embroidered manner than found in the fairy tale. Ivan comes across a certain door in the dungeons of his sister's castle and opens it entirely out of idle curiosity. There he discovers Koshchei, condemned to starvation by the Countess. The prince frees him, feeds him, and then the two negotiate a treaty of peace to resolve the issues that had been the source of conflict between Koshchei and Marya. But when they set out to inform her of this happy news, Koshchei falls helplessly in love with her, and stages a revolt in order to carry Marya away with him.

They note [Chivers and Hladik 1984, p. 216]:\nNo mammal mixes large quantities of both animal matter and leaves in its diet without including fruit. Since faunivory and folivory seem to represent contrasting and incompatible [morphological] adaptations, the quantity of fruit in such a mixed diet is always considerable.\nThe objection of Chivers and Hladik to the term omnivore appears to reflect a different view of the definition of the term than is used by many other authors. This will be discussed later in this section.\nDetermining/measuring relevant gut characteristics is non-trivial. Chivers and Hladik [1980] includes a discussion of the major challenges involved in measuring the relevant gut parameters--volume, surface area, etc. Additional challenges include: the gut itself is elastic (i.e., it may stretch when you try to measure it), consists of irregular shapes which may be complicated by folds or specialized structures, and so on. In the real world, choosing what parameters to measure and how to measure them, in the area of gut morphology, is decidedly non-trivial. The simplistic comparative proofs of diet don't bother to tell you such details.\nBasic raw data collected: For the subject animals, the sizes of stomach, large intestine, and small intestine were all measured in terms of surface area, weight, and volume. Data on overall size of the animal--length and weight--were recorded as well."
"outbreak.\nGo beyond a simple \u201cHow are you?\u201d and ask specific questions about what supports would be helpful. Wait for the full answer. Really listen, and encourage questions and concerns. Of course, be careful not to be overbearing; that could signal a lack of trust or a desire to micromanage.\nWhen someone shares that they\u2019re struggling, you won\u2019t always know what to say or do. What\u2019s most important is to make space to hear how your team members are truly doing and to be compassionate. They may not want to share much detail, which is completely fine. Knowing that they can is what matters.\nOffer flexibility and be inclusive. Expect that the situation, your team\u2019s needs, and your own needs will continue to change. Check in regularly \u2014 particularly at transition points. You can help problem-solve any issues that come up only if you know what\u2019s happening. Those conversations will also give you an opportunity to reiterate norms and practices that support mental health. Inclusive flexibility is about proactive communication and norm-setting that helps people design and preserve the boundaries they need.\nDon\u2019t make assumptions about what your direct reports need; they will most likely need different things at different times. Take a customized approach to addressing stressors, such as challenges with childcare or feeling the need to work all the time. Proactively offer flexibility. Be as generous and realistic as possible. Basecamp CEO Jason Fried recently announced that employees with any type of caretaking responsibilities could set their own schedules, even if that meant working fewer hours. Being accommodating doesn\u2019t necessarily mean lowering your standards. Flexibility can help your team thrive amid the continued uncertainty.\nNormalize and model this new flexibility by highlighting how you\u2019ve changed your own behavior. Stacey Sprenkel, a partner at the law firm Morrison & Foerster, proactively told her teams that she was working odd hours because of her childcare responsibilities and invited them to share what they needed to work best during the pandemic.\nAsk team members to be patient and understanding with one another as they adapt. Trust them and assume the best. They are relying on you and will remember how you treated them during this unprecedented time.\nCommunicate more than you think you"

Conspicuous male coloration impairs survival against avian predators in Aegean wall lizards, Podarcis erhardii. Ecology and evolution, 5(18), 4115-4131.\nConspicuous male coloration impairs survival against avian predators in Aegean wall lizards, Podarcis erhardii.\nAnimal coloration is strikingly diverse in nature. Within-species color variation can arise through local adaptation for camouflage, sexual dimorphism and conspicuous sexual signals, which often have conflicting effects on survival. Here, we tested whether color variation between two island populations of Aegean wall lizards (Podarcis erhardii) is due to sexual dimorphism and differential survival of individuals varying in appearance. On both islands, we measured attack rates by wild avian predators on clay models matching the coloration of real male and female P. erhardii from each island population, modeled to avian predator vision. Avian predator attack rates differed among model treatments, although only on one island. Male-colored models, which were more conspicuous against their experimental backgrounds to avian predators, were accordingly detected and attacked more frequently by birds than less conspicuous female-colored models. This suggests that female coloration has evolved primarily under selection for camouflage, whereas sexually competing males exhibit costly conspicuous coloration. Unexpectedly, there was no difference in avian attack frequency between local and non-local model types. This may have arisen if the models did not resemble lizard coloration with sufficient precision, or if real lizards behaviorally choose backgrounds that improve camouflage. Overall, these results show that sexually dimorphic coloration can affect the risk of predator attacks, indicating that color variation within a species can be caused by interactions between natural and sexual selection. However, more work is needed to determine how these findings depend on the island environment that each population inhabits.\nTrosci"

"considerably more edifying than the work of Kassabian, but not without methodological problems.

Audissino rejects a \u2018separatist\u2019 view of the visual and aural aspects of a film, presenting as an alternative a view of a film as \u2018as an integrated system of elements (say, a soup)\u2019, whereby an analysis should \u2018break down the single substance to its single ingredients (tomatoes, salt, oil, etc.)\u2019 Powell was quite amazed by the idea that an integrated system of music and image (like a Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk) might be seen as a \u2018soup\u2019, and in contrast presented the view from Ludwig von Bertalanaffy\u2019s General System Theory (New York: Braziller, 1968):\nA system can be defined as a set of elements standing in interrelations. Interrelation means that elements, p, stand in relations, R, so that the behavior of an element p in R is different from its behavior in another relation, R\u2019.\nIn a film, a piece of music \u2018behaves\u2019 differently to how it would in another film, or a concert hall, argued Powell, but the concept of the system means that its identity is not wholly dissolved in the process, as the metaphor of the soup might imply.\nAudissino cites an analysis by Frank Lehman of John Williams\u2019 score to Raiders of the Lost Ark in which a cadence is coordinated with the discovery of the Ark, and is \u2018exactly in synch with the sun rays\u2019. But Powell subtly probed the use of the concept of \u2018function\u2019 for music in such a context, whereby it implies a teleological view by which a coupling of music and image is required to be \u2018effective\u2019 or \u2018work\u2019.

When asked, Henderson claims that the sidecars are employed to better allow him to \"cause a f*ckus with the boyz.\" While he is occasionally seen with teammate Stu Trololol as well, manager Cornelius Games has commented that \"those two absolutely cannot be together for more than five minutes or I swear to God the insufferable aura they generate will cause a category 5 hurricane of irritation.\" The veracity of this claim has yet to be tested.\nHe is not a Baltimore native and, when playing for the Crabs, he frequently left the Crabitat while not pitching a game to vacation at his father's summer homes. This behavior did not change when he became a batter, but the commute left him much crankier. Prior to season 9, Tillman stated several times on record that he \"cannot be killed\" by the rogue umpires. These statements are now on record as notably false.\nCreate New Rumor\nTo create a new Rumor for Tillman Henderson, use the Page Creation tool to the right.

The singer is this big Irish guy who\u2019s old band apparently played with Speedhorn back in the day, In don\u2019t really recognize him though, which is strange because he\u2019s a big bugger covered in tats, so you\u2019d think I\u2019d remember. Seems like a nice guy anyway, he\u2019s straight there helping out with carrying the gear in.\nTurns out they forgot to bring Paul\u2019s guitar though so they have a dash back to their space to pick it up. In the meantime Alec turns up. It\u2019s really great to see him. Alec played in Ninth Circle which was the first band Speedhorn ever toured with and we\u2019ve been friends since. Alec is such a friendly guy, that soft Scottish accent of his making him very approachable. We sit down and catch up, mostly on what\u2019s going on with our lives. I\u2019m really interested in how he\u2019s doing in Ostrava. He tells me that he\u2019s been a bit sauced up over the weekend, that they celebrate Easter here in the Czech Republic in a very special way which involves everyone getting steamboats. Apparently the tradition is that the men in the city make these whips out of willow branches and the crack is that they go around all the houses, don\u2019t have to know the occupants, walk in and smack the women on the arse with the whips, upon which they\u2019re given a shot of Czech booze. And this starts around four am! Fucking mental. Alec says it freaked him out a bit and he was fucked by ten am. Bonkers.\nJust as we\u2019re contemplating ringing the promoter to find out where he is, worrying a little about the fact it\u2019s seven fifteen and Symsey\u2019s band is on at eight, we\u2019re all Hank Marvin too, he turns up. This big tall skinny guy with long black hair and glasses. He sorts us out with some veggie goulash immediately. It does the job if nothing else. At least we\u2019re not as stuffed as we were yesterday, I couldn\u2019t handle another gig like that. Symsey\u2019s band go on at eight and the place is"

"MUSIC CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE OF HAUNTED HOUSES COAST-TO-COAST, SORTA / MAYBE\nNo, this time we\u2019re not kidding.\nFor many people, their first and only exposure to classical music is in silly cartoons.\nFor others, classical music is an everyday experience. For example, imagine waking up to the sound of 2 grand pianos being played simultaneously downstairs in music like Suite No. 2 in C minor by Rachmaninov.\nFOR HEIGHTS & DEPTHS NO WORDS CAN REACH, MUSIC IS THE SOUL\u2019S OWN SPEECH\nBut what does this have to do with changing the haunted attraction scene all the way from Detroit to the State of Washington?\nPerhaps everything, and it all goes back to the vision of one man on a creative mission from beyond.\nHis name was PAT McELROY, a man who wore many hats. Most people knew him as a DJ / on air personality on classical music radio station WQRS-FM 105.9 in DETROIT. He spoke with a seductive sultry voice, and captivated the public with his intriguing insightful viewpoints.\nMcELROY became well-known in the Detroit actors community & art circles. Despite his mild-mannered demeanor / appearance, he harbored a TASTE FOR THE BIZARRE that eventually manifested itself in the 1980s as the legendary MAXWORLD interactive haunted house on WARREN AVE. in DETROIT.\nMAXWORLD was the quintessential interactive experience like-no-other!\nIt was built in a real multi-level residential house, but the show started with some exquisitely bizarre art in the garage.\nTHE BEWILDERED BRETHREN roamed the property, confusing themselves to hilarious results.\nThe city inspectors had no idea what was going on in this MADHOUSE BEYOND BELIEF!\nLike all haunts, MAXWORLD eventually sang their final SWAN SONG as McELROY had an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse from the state of Washington for"
"es of yellow and white flowering bushes with patches of other flowers along the way including some orchids. The rain added to the glossy green of the bush although it didn't take long for the limestone track to form puddles and rivulets when the rain arrived leading to some very soggy feet!\nAfter terrible fires went through this bush in 2000 there are lots of interesting burnt out tree stumps along the way which give you an indication of how ferocious the fire was.\nThe walk from Burns Beach to Neerabup Road is a good hour each way but if this is too long you could explore the trail for 30 minutes and then return. Because the trail has inclines the return journey offers slightly different views making both directions interesting.\nI love the way they have planned this trail to wind in and out rather than making it a straight track as the winding track lends interest. The limestone trails were level and easy to walk on and best of all their pale colour lends itself to snake spotting!\nNear the Neerabup Road bridge there were a few man made bumps and side trails for the mountain bikers. The trail is wide enough for the bikers to overtake if you stick to the left.\nWe really enjoyed this walk and regret not discovering it sooner. Like most trails there are better times of the year than others to walk it. Winter and springtime are probably the best however it was quite shaded so it may be ok in summer except on a really hot day.\nThere is a small carpark with access from Burns Beach Road or you can park on the verge. There are no toilets but during sporting events at Windermere Oval you can access toilets and parking here.....it is only a few extra minutes walk from the trail head but you will have to cross Burns Beach Road.\nThe Yaberoo Budjara Heritage Trail follows the ancient Aboriginal migration route between Lake Joondalup and Loch McNess in Yanchep National Park.

"It was through just seeing Lara on the screen and I was mesmerized from that moment seeing her in game. From a young age, I just felt if she could do it, so could I. Lara has been such an influence to me throughout my life, I think she\u2019s been such an iconic female in so many ways, not just to myself but to millions of fans across the globe. I think that with having such a strong woman in a game, growing up she was someone who I looked up to.\nI felt I could relate to her as she did her own thing and didn\u2019t let anything stop her from what she wanted to do. In my experience, because I had always been \u201aone of the boys\u2018, it was refreshing to be able to look up to such a woman who hadn\u2019t been created to shy away from anything, nor be just a token female that needed to be rescued. I\u2019d usually be running around the playground believing I was Lara Croft, dodging tigers, atlantean creatures and/or Larson or Pierre.\nMy favourite game will always be the original Tomb Raider (1996). As for the reasons above among many others, it was so groundbreaking for me. Not only was it incredibly challenging, you didn\u2019t have any other games like it back then. Nathan McCree\u2019s music is still incredible to this day, Shelley Blond\u2019s voice for Lara was just perfection, vocalised with the sharp wit that I still adore. Along with Toby Gard and Core Design\u2019s work, not forgetting to credit Vicky Arnold for her wonderful story in that game, as with many others.\nIt just brings back wonderful memories with that game in particular for me. You really felt isolated and your path wasn\u2019t obvious as it is in most modern games. I do love the other Tomb Raider games, especially 1-6 as the characterization of Lara, for me, excels. I do enjoy the era of LAU, but the Core years will always be my favourite.\nYou are well-known within the fan community for making cross stitching with Tomb Raider motives.

Hardware designers have come up with ever more sophisticated memory handling and acceleration techniques\u2013such as CPU caches\u2013but these cannot work optimally without some help from the programmer. Unfortunately, neither the structure nor the cost of using the memory subsystem of a computer or the caches on CPUs is well understood by most programmers.\nThis document explains the structure of memory subsystems in use on modern commodity hardware, illustrating why CPU caches were developed, how they work, and what programs should do to achieve optimal performance by utilizing them.\nThis document is mostly for software developers. It does not go into enough technical details of the hardware to be useful for hardware-oriented readers.

"aris ARB uses two blades joined by an elegant arched guide\nFerrari have used this solution at least since the late nineties, the idea has been seen on older Minardis too. I suspect the idea was taken to Minardi by Gustav Brunner, who may also be the creator of this elegant solution.\nSimilar to McLaren the roll stiffness is provided by blades splined to the rockers. But the connecting mechanism is instead a single bearing sliding inside an arched guide. Just as with McLaren ARB, when in roll the two ends push against each other to create the reaction force to prevent roll. When in heave the bearing slides through the arc of the guide and no force is passed into the suspension.\nI don\u2019t believe either of these solutions has a compliance benefit over the other. The McLaren\\Ferrari systems may be take up a little less space inside the nose and may weigh a little less.

"do will be nailed to the pillar of shame for all of history,\" Vice Premier Sun Chunlan warned in an article in the party's flagship newspaper after visiting Hubei province. \"Be selfless, and race against time. We must go all out to solve the problem of inaccurate, inadequate implementation.\"\nStage 3: Control the narrative\nWithin the quarantine zone, people have been confined to their apartments or new mass quarantine wards. But online, information began to proliferate.\nMuckraking Chinese journalists have been publishing interviews with doctors with damning details that sometimes contradict official accounts. One piece, since deleted by censors, alleges the official tally of infected patients is far lower than the true scale of the outbreak, citing several Wuhan doctors.\nTo counteract the critical coverage of the Wuhan quarantine, the Communist Party's publicity department dispatched over 300 reporters from state media agencies to Wuhan and Hubei province earlier this week.\nNot long after, authorities began turning to a more familiar tool for narrative control: censorship.\nGovernment cyberspace regulators mandated in a notice on Wednesday that the country's biggest Internet companies, including Tencent, Baidu and ByteDance, \"conduct special supervision\" on epidemic-related news. Soon after, social media platforms, including WeChat, began suspending accounts found to have spread \"sensitive information or illegal content,\" according to screenshots of sealed accounts. Tencent did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.\n\"I think what this act is telling us is that the discussions online are entering into the zone of perceived sensitivity for the state,\" says Repnikova of Georgia State University. While earlier, uninhibited reporting provided valuable public knowledge about the outbreak, \"it's evident that more supplies and more diagnostic equipment are needed. The benefit of allowing more social media critique is also getting slimmer.\"\nOne of the thousands of WeChat accounts suspended this week belonged to Triv Wen, a Beijing municipal engineer.

S4E10. If you\u2019re new to the AHS franchise, Episode 10 marks a turn toward the end of the show, when all of the rules change, things you have held as sacred are torn apart, and anyone\u2014anyone\u2014could die at any moment. Now, we know from media reports that Lily Rabe is set to reprise her role in tonight\u2019s episode, marking the second character crossover after Naomi Grossman\u2019s Pepper.\nAnd so it begins.\nThe beginning of the end.\nElsa starts out narrating what it\u2019s like to lose one of the monsters. We see Salty and Pepper sleeping together. Only Salty isn\u2019t sleeping. He\u2019s dead. Paul gently explains that Salty is just a shell. She still clings to him.\nElsa"
"ian albedo is also likely to show the smallest temporal variations among the studied bodies. Earth has the second highest ECS to albedo perturbations suggesting that the albedos of Mars, Titan and Triton might be more dynamic (less stable) on decadal-to-centennial time scales compared to the Earth\u2019s albedo.\nThe above estimate of Earth\u2019s ECS to total pressure (0.161 K/kPa) can be used to calculate the response of global surface temperature to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 compared to a preindustrial level of 280 ppm. According to the Nikolov-Zeller discovery about the adiabatic nature of the atmospheric thermal effect, a change in the amount of any gas in the atmosphere (including CO2) impacts global temperature only through the contribution of such a change to total surface air pressure. In other words, what matters for the global thermal environment at the surface is the partial pressure of gases, not their infrared radiative properties. Thus, a 280 ppm increase of atmospheric CO2 implies a 0.0276 kPa increase of surface air pressure (i.e. 98.55*280/106 = 0.0276 kPa). Multiplying this perturbation by the ECS to pressure yields the true response of our planet\u2019s global surface temperature to a CO2 doubling: 0.0276*0.161 = 0.0044 K. This amount of global warming is practically undetectable. Hence, current climate models overestimate the Earth\u2019s global temperature sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 about 682 times or by 68,100% on average (i.e. 3.0/0.0044 = 681.8).\nDerivation of exact analytical formulas for estimating the equilibrium climate sensitivities of planetary bodies to shortwave radiative forcing and surface atmospheric pressure was possible thanks to a new robust model of global surface temperature inferred from NASA planetary data by Nikolov & Zeller (2017). The model provides novel insights about the role of albedo in climate and into the physical nature of the Atmospheric Therm"
"ises continue to branch out, and that soon there will be an important development involving our good friends of Grimerica --stay tuned, boy & girls!\n10 Our first Red Pill is a follow-up to a story we mentioned last March, when it was revealed how the Planck telescope confirmed a mysterious distribution of the background microwave radiation in the Universe, along what Cosmologists like to call the 'Axis of Evil,' because we know how scientists like to mock the things they don't understand --Big Bang anyone?\nNow an article on The Daily Mail reports on Dr. Laura Mersini-Houghton, a theoretical physicist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who says the map of the Universe drawn by Planck further confirms a theory she proposed in 2005 along with Richard Holman, professor at Carnegie Mellon University. What is it they proposed that merits a mention in this column? Simply put, that the anomalous distribution of radiation in the Universe is the result of other universes exerting an influence on our own.\nActual photo of the multiverse\nShe said: 'These anomalies were caused by other universes pulling on our universe as it formed during the Big Bang.\n'They are the first hard evidence for the existence of other universes that we have seen.'\nNeedless to say, many of her colleagues remain skeptical. But if proven right, then this finding would constitute physical, measurable evidence that everything we can detect with our most powerful telescopes, is just part of a small bubble swimming around an infinite sea. And if other Universes past or present can exert a gravitational pull in the microwave radiation, does that mean Dark matter & dark energy will follow the fate of the luminiferous ether?\nTelescopes in...SPAAAAACE\nIf there are other Universes surrounding our own, do they follow the same laws of Physics? does light in them travel faster or slower? do they have stars & planets where life can evolve?

"iance with which Don Mee Choi has labored to bring Kim Hyesoon\u2019s oeuvre into English. When I first read Don Mee\u2019s translations in Circumference Magazine nearly a decade ago, I turned to the then au courant digital media of message boards and list servs to try to track her down. Susan Schultz, poet and editor of Hawaii\u2019s TinFish Press, finally acquainted us. Don Mee was receptive but possibly a little alarmed to hear how ardently Johannes and I, the editors of a new press, Action Books, wanted to work with her to bring a volume of her Kim Hyesoon translations to US readers. We have since brought out four titles, each featuring exciting selections of Kim\u2019s work alongside interviews, prefaces, and essays\u2014all translated, selected, and compiled by Don Mee Choi. In many ways, Kim Hyesoon\u2019s body of work in English is actually a kind of double, a non-identical twin volatilely and unstably conjoined with her Korean body of work, constantly morphing in shape and tone, uncannily vivified by the double supply of artistry that runs between Kim Hyesoon and Don Mee Choi.\nSince our first volume, Mommy Must be a Fountain of Feathers (2008), which was in fact proceeded by various journal and anthology publications and TinFish\u2019s deceptively demure pink chapbook, When the Plug Comes Unplugged (2005) as well as a substantial selection in Don Mee Choi\u2019s groundbreaking Anxiety of Words (Zephyr Press, 2006), Kim Hyesoon\u2019s English influence has actively contaminated the zone of US poetry, finding fans across the spectrum from novice poetry students to US Poet Laureate Robert Hass. On the strength of Don Mee Choi\u2019s translations, Kim Hyesoon has expanded her European and global readership. As a sign of her global prominence, Kim Hyesoon was invited to read with Nobel Laureates Seamus Heaney and Wole Soyinka during the Poetry Parnassus which preceded the London Olympics in 2012.

"format.\nAlso, being able to swap lcm\u2019s both between shops (at least within an agglomeration) and between goods categories, company management can try cheap and illustrative experiments to detect the root causes of some problems: is the shop really poorly located? Or is it the local personnel\u2019s failure? Do teapots really fail to sell at our company for some mystical reasons or is the respective pcm underqualified?\nThe above theoretical scheme can be applied to any number of goods categories and shops.\nIf, as we have already written in the first section, the outlet geography includes regions with vastly different market conditions, then the two-tier \"central product manager \u2014 shop product manager\" system will be transformed into a three-tier one, \"central product category manager \u2014 regional product category\nmanager \u2014 shop product category manager\".\nFor convenience of administration, the number of each node\u2019s subordinate links should not exceed ten (ideally, seven).\nA scheme with more than three levels is inefficient in the practice.\nAnd now let us apply the theoretical scheme to practice and discuss the most frequent difficulties.\n7.1Situation: a big network with a central warehouse and regional second-level allocation warehouses. How do they fit in?\nSolution: managing the assortment at regional warehouses is the competence of regional product managers. In this case they are positioned in relation to the central product category manager exactly like the shops\" local product managers are in relation to themselves.\n7.2Situation: pure arithmetic says that following the principles of \"not more than three levels in\nthe scheme\" and \"not more than ten persons reporting to a mode\" limits the number of your shops to 1000. What do we do if we have more?\nin the case of a network comprising big shops, we most probably deal with a trans-national company (and how many IKEA or Metro shops are there in Russia?) that is organised as a holding company in which the operating companies catering to local markets are responsible to the headquarters in terms of financial performance only.\nThere just a few cases like Walmart worldwide. But, on the one hand, they have little to do with the e-commerce business issues under review and rather belong, with their base assortment, to"

The film has a way of swerving just south of every question asked and a knack for making you feel like this story is open ended and unsolved. Unsolved is different than unproved though, and if everything that Depp\u2019s Russell Poole cataloged and uncovered is for real then it\u2019s no wonder this film never saw a major release and was held up for so long.

Released in 1997, McFarlane's Monsters is one of my favorite toylines and I've reviewed a few of the sets previously, including the Werewolf Playset back during the original 31 Days of Toy Terror. For McFarlane's Monsters McFarlane Toys went smaller with their figures, including two figures and a diorama like playset in each set. The Hunchback of Notre Dame set was the first set I found of these and it definitely seemed to be the least popular of the sets. I'm not sure if that had to do with the fact that the Disney film had come out the year before or just because Quasimodo is such a strange choice for a monster line. As I've said before, he's not a monster despite appearing in a Universal film. Maybe the implication is that the vicious executioner this set comes with is the true monster and Quasimodo must overcome him!

"Zealand\nLying to the west of Tongariro National Park and centred on Te Kuiti, is a vast region of endless razorback ridges and deep isolated valleys.\nThe King Country extends southwards into the Awakino, Mokau and Whanganui catchments embracing a huge variety of wilderness areas, which offer a supreme challenge for fair chase hunters. More than 20 state forests are available to hunters in this region \u2013 they are scattered remnants of the once majestic indigenous podocarp forests that clothed the entire landscape. Pureora is the largest remaining block with outliers such as Whareorino, Waitomo, Hauturu and Tawarau.\nPureora is a magnificent forest of ancient podocarps like totara, rimu, matai, miro and kahikatea, and is regarded as a paradise for the outdoors person, offering red deer of trophy standard. If you want to hear the full-blooded battle cry of a stag during the April/May roar then Pureora is a good place to start.\nRed deer are present in most of the King Country forests in low to moderate numbers. The more remote Pureora valleys in the Rangitoto and Hauhungaroa Ranges have the highest densities and the North Block, designated as a Recreational Hunting Area, offers good prospects.\nWild pigs are well established in the exotic forest plantations and scrubland around the towns of Tokoroa, Mangakino, Waitomo and Te Kuiti. Waitomo is an interesting area to hunt because of its dual landscapes and fascinating limestone formations. The area is famous for its glow worm studded caves and the dark, hidden underground caverns and streams. The above-ground landscape also has deep hideaways in dense bush for wild game. Add the Whanganui National Park to the above King Country areas and you have the highest concentration of wild pigs in New Zealand.\nGoats are found in low to moderate numbers throughout the coastal ranges, which extend into Taranaki.\nDucks and pheasants are found in low numbers throughout the King Country wetlands and lowland areas.\nGuided hunting safaris in"

"you can now edit your own team of three fighters, by choosing among all the panel of characters, while still retaining the option to select the standard teams. Incidentally, to view the 'real' endings, players have to use one of these basic teams. The possibilities are increased tenfold with this new opportunity, and we now have the pleasure to combine our favorite fighters together, by creating for example a crew including Ryo, Terry and Kyo! This option should delight many players, who can finally, for the first time in the series, realize their dream of making their team packing both heroes of Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting. Meanwhile, the single game is still available, plus a true comprehensive versus mode: what more could we ask?\nThe roster has not evolved much since it still features twenty-four fighters in this episode, but its quality has been improved with a better balance between warriors, new combos and special moves revisited and enriched, ans also the (excellent) newcomers. Exit the USA team, the least interesting of all, moreover, the three new players replacing them are sharp, powerful and more exciting to play. The difficulty of the game has also been revised upwards, and frankly we'll have to hang on to clear Kof 95. Both Bosses (Rugal and Saysiu) are hard to beat and will show no mercy. Working you r technique, timing and combos will prove necessary to progress in this episode, and that's a good thing. The action acquires an additional depth and adepts of technical fights will be pleased. Aesthetes too, because everything is remarkably beautiful. We remember especially the USA background (with the factory), or the China stage with its flowering trees and waterfalls ...\nThe characters have been slightly re-worked and they look thinner, and also move in a much more natural and smoother way. New melodies made their appearance, sound effects have been enhanced to be more impactful and vocal digits are slightly more numerous than before. So technically, SNK managed to provide a slightly higher episode than the 94', but hey, we expected that a little! The most important point is probably the gameplay, which gains depth: counters during dodge, jumps on two levels, game speed increased, plus"

"MAO inhibitors, i.e. up to twice as many patients had relief of depression compared to the standard drugs. In addition, Ketamine had a very rapid response rate, with many patients noting a dramatic elevation in mood and dissipation of depression symptoms within a few hours to a few days, compared to response rates of several weeks with the standard drugs. This may be because the glutamate neurological pathways respond much more rapidly to medications than the serotonin and dopamine neurological pathways which are influenced by standard antidepressants.\nKetamine infusions create a cascade of events in the brain that affects certain neurotransmitter receptors and neurological pathways, and triggers rapid growth of normal neural conditions. This rewiring of the brain is thought to be the basis of the antidepressant effect. In addition, Ketamine is a powerful anti-inflammatory medication. Since depression has been linked to chronic inflammation, this may also be a part of its antidepressant effect. This may be why some patients achieve long-term relief after just one infusion or one short series of infusions. Others will find that Ketamine infusions enhanced with oral medicines, lifestyle changes and other choices will dramatically reduce depression symptoms.\nEveryone reacts differently to medications of all kinds, so we customize treatments, including frequency and dosage, specifically to your requirements. Research shows that 70% to 80% of patients have experienced significant relief for treatment of depression using Ketamine infusions.\nWe know that typical antidepressants work well in only 30% to 40% of patients with depression. Ketamine works over 85% of the time, even for those who have failed typical antidepressant therapy. There is good evidence that Ketamine might work for patients suffering from most other forms of depression, not just those who are treatment resistant.\nExperts are calling Low Dose IV Infusion Ketamine the most significant advance in mental health treatment in the past 50-years. Since 2006, many studies have shown that Ketamine can also reverse the"

Photo: Sergio P\u00e9rez/AFP\nThe Spanish Government in February defied opposition pressure and voted to close investigations into as many as a dozen high profile Spanish-led international cases including alleged Chinese genocide in Tibet and possible torture in the US prison facility of Guantanamo Bay.\nOn Friday, the move \u2014 described by many as an end to Spain's concept of 'universal justice' \u2014 was made official when it was published in the country's Official State Bulletin.\nUnder the new rules, Spanish courts can only try crimes committed on Spanish soil.\nBut on Monday, Santiago Pedraz, a judge with Spain's National Court, said he wouldn't stop investigating the 2003 death of Spanish cameraman Jos\u00e9 Couso in Iraq.\nCouso was one of three journalists killed on April 8th 2003 in Baghdad during the US invasion of the city.\nExplaining his ruling, Pedraz said he was obliged to pursue the case under the Fourth Geneva Convention, ratified by Spain, which deals with the protection of civilians during war time.\nHe then stressed that internal rule changes in Spain didn't alter that international obligation.\nSpain has issued a search and capture order for three US military personnel for crimes against the international community and homicide.\nIn January, Pedraz officially approached Spain's justice minister to complain about a lack of US cooperation in the case.\nThe Spanish Government announced earlier this year it was looking at shutting down up to a dozen cases involving genocide, torture and war crimes.\nIn February, a Spanish judge sought international arrest warrants for former Chinese President Jiang Zemin and four other top Chinese officials as part of a probe into alleged genocide in Tibet.\nThis sparked out"

"ight of Fresno to Detroit. That's right. Fresno, where they grow almonds and make lots of raisins is what she compared to Detroit, that bigger city on a Great Lake where they pretty much grow shipyards, auto plants, and Motown, once upon a time.\nAnd how did Candidate Whitman lose her shoe this time? Through a time honored tradition, candidates meet with various newspaper editorial boards for interviews as the election nears. Editorial boards then sum up the meeting and give a thumbs up or down to the candidate.\nCandidate Whitman's editorial adventure with the San Jose Merc did not go well. Meeting with the editorial board of the San Jose Mercury News she began the conversation saying that Fresno was as awful as Detroit. Really?\nWhen asked to clarify, Candidate Whitman shoveled a little deeper.\n\"Fresno looks worse than Detroit. It's awful.\" She acknowledged it didn't go over well, and explained, \"I made a comparison between Fresno and Detroit. It wasn't all that well received but what I was trying to say, what I meant to say, what was absolutely imbedded in those remarks is that it is not acceptable Detroit has a lower unemployment rate than Fresno.\"\nBut let's add a little logic to that simplistic comparison of \"awful\" made by Whitman. Numbers are not always equally significant. Fresno has a population of about 500K while Detroit's numbers are approaching 1M. That 15% unemployment in Fresno and 14% unemployment in Detroit actually makes the automobile city's suffering much more \"awful\" (using the Whitman awful-scale) based on real numbers of people out of work. And a bright 5th grader might know that each city's various industries are not similar, the unemployed worker profiles are vastly different, and the overall recovery patterns would not be nearly the same.\nAnd just for fun, let\u2019s help out Candidate Whitman with a few more relevant facts.\nFresno is steeped in California history as part of the gold rush and early railroad industry.

"ushi and sashimi. Unsurprisingly, given today\u2019s fish prices, no restaurant has managed to achieve the same delicate balancing act as well as Ten Ten Tei did.

The quality of their fish, especially at Jugemu, remains impressive for the relatively scant amounts of money they charge for it.

One hopes that something equally worthwhile will take the place of the now-closed Abeno Too, given its prime spot near Leicester Square. Unfortunately that very location stokes fears that some desperately mediocre tourist trap will snap it up instead. Fortunately, the original Abeno on Museum Street is still in operation. I\u2019m terrible at predicting future food \u2018trends\u2019, so I can only hope that okonomiyaki becomes the next \u2018big thing\u2019.

Whether it\u2019s a green and gold selfie or a Hail Mary reaction, Packers fans are sharing their thoughts digitally. In fact, Sunday\u2019s Wild Card game between the Packers and Giants set the record for the most mobile data ever used in the holy land of Lambeau Field (the most Instagrammed place in Wisconsin in 2016), 1.2 terabytes to be exact, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.\nBack in late November, the 4-6 Packers were riding a 4-game losing streak when MVP quarterback Aaron Rodgers stated he thought the Packers could \u201crun the table\u201d to get into the postseason.

"otham\u201d, they\u2019re reminded of the Batman comics and movies. When I hear it, I think only of New York City, often wondering how it got that nickname. As it turns out, author and NYC native Washington Irving, of Icabod Crane fame, made the association over 120 years ago.\nIrving published a satirical periodical, Salmagundi, in which he wrote articles that poked fun at and lampooned the city and its more eccentric residents. He learned of a medieval English village called Gotham, meaning \u201cgoat town\u201d, whose inhabitants conspired to keep a king from bringing chaos and higher taxes to the home they loved. An ancient folk tale called The Wise Men of Gotham likely served as Irving\u2019s inspiration. While Batman\u2019s Gotham is a dark, dangerous, and brooding place, Irving\u2019s couldn\u2019t have been more different.\nThe legend relates how, when King John planned to build a hunting lodge in their woods, Gotham\u2019s residents greeted a planning visit from the king\u2019s knights by feigning madness. They took turns doing things like trying to drown an eel in their pond and fencing in a bush to prevent a cuckoo from escaping. A man was seen carrying 2 bushels of grain on his back while leading his horse, telling everyone that the bushels were too heavy for the horse to carry. Madness being considered highly contagious, the knights soon left to advise the king to look elsewhere for a building site.\nIn 1907, Washington Irving adopted the name Gotham for NYC. New Yorkers embraced it, and it stuck. As for Gotham, which was originally pronounced Goat-um, that town has a Cuckoo Bush inn, Cuckoo Bush Mound, and a weathervane with a Batman figure on it.\nAmericanEnglandHistorymedievalNew Yorktradition\n4 thoughts on \u201cWhy NYC is Called Gotham\u201d\nThe Chronicles of History says:\nVery interesting read!\nkatknit says:\nThanks!

"arachnoid hemorrhage and severe head injury. The rationale is to improve blood flow to the injured brain and prevent secondary ischemia.\nAB - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The intent of this manuscript is to summarize the pathophysiologic basis for hemodynamic manipulation in subarachnoid hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury, highlight the most recent literature and present expert opinion on indications and use. RECENT FINDINGS: Hemodynamic augmentation with vasopressors and inotropes along with hypervolemia are the mainstay of treatment of vasospasm due to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Considerable variation continues to exist regarding fluid management and the use of vasopressors and inotropes. Blood pressure augmentation, volume expansion and cardiac contractility enhancement improve cerebral blood flow in ischemic areas, ameliorate vasospasm and improve clinical condition. In patients suffering from severe traumatic brain injury, while every attempt is made to control intracranial hypertension, cerebral perfusion-directed therapy with fluids and vasopressors is also used to keep cerebral perfusion pressure above 60-70 mmHg. Yet, recent observations suggest that posttraumatic mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed as an alternative explanation for lower cerebral blood flow after acute trauma. SUMMARY: Hemodynamic manipulation is routinely used in the management of patients with acute vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage and severe head injury. The rationale is to improve blood flow to the injured brain and prevent secondary ischemia.\nKW - Cerebral perfusion pressure\nKW - Cerebral vasospasm\nKW - Hemodynamic augmentation\nKW - Subarachnoid hemorrhage\nU2 - 10.1097/MCC.0b013e32807f2aa5\nDO - 10.1097/MCC.0b013e32807f2aa5\nJO - Current Opinion in Critical Care\nJF - Current Opinion in Critical Care\nDiringer MN"

Harris says:\nThe full picture of the Windows 8 experience will only emerge when new hardware from our partners becomes available, and when the Store opens up for all developers to start submitting their new apps.\nAgreed; but it also seems that Windows 8 will ship with a number of annoyances which at the moment Microsoft looks unlikely to fix. These are mainly in the integration, or lack of it, between the Metro-style UI and the desktop. I can live without the Start menu, but will miss the taskbar with its guide to running applications and its preview thumbnails; these remain in the desktop but do not include Metro apps. Having only full-screen apps can be irritation, and I wonder if the commitment to the single-app \u201cimmersive UI\u201d has been taken too far. When working in Windows 8 I miss the little clock that sits in the notification area; you have to swipe to see the equivalent and the fast and fluid UI is making me work harder than before.\nI believe Microsoft will listen to complaints like these, but probably not until Windows 9.

Sadly, the boy eventually died, sometime after the startling announcement that he had been cured. The constant nurture and love from his parents probably helped to extend his life.\nA man in Iowa who advocated for marijuana also died of cancer. In Australia, a little girl whose father had been treating her neuroblastoma with cannabis oil died in May. Receiving constant love, attention and kind wishes from others sent good vibes into the world, but no medical professional thought it had an effect on the cancer.\nIt is understandable why some parents with little hope for their child would prefer such oils over harsh chemotherapy.\nWe do not criticize the parents for trying alternative treatments. However, advocacy for these parents should not be used to further the agenda of legalization.\nWhen reading about the remarkable claims advocates of medical marijuana propose, please remember the placebo effect. We don\u2019t know why placebos cure some people and not others. It could be the power of belief, or the result of a person\u2019s own immune system having the ability to fight the disease.\nParents Opposed to Pot objects to the tactics of marijuana lobbyists because:\nThey give partial truths, attempt to sway public opinion while hiding essential facts.\nThey engage in unfair defamation of character and advertising.

"and Therapeutics Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\nPharmacokinetics and Biodistribution of the Illegal Food Colorant Rhodamine B in Rats.\nCheng, Yung-Yi; Tsai, Tung-Hu\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) demonstrated rhodamine B as a potential carcinogen in 1978. Nevertheless, rhodamine B has been illegally used as a colorant in food in many countries. Few pharmacokinetic and toxicological investigations have been performed since the first pharmacokinetic study on rhodamine B in 1961. The aims of this study were to develop a simple and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography method with fluorescence detection for the quantitative detection of rhodamine B in the plasma and organs of rats and to estimate its pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. The results demonstrated that the oral bioavailabilities of rhodamine B were 28.3 and 9.8% for the low-dose and high-dose exposures, respectively. Furthermore, rhodamine B was highly accumulated in the liver and, to a lesser extent, the kidney, but was undetectable in the brain. These results provide useful information for improving the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of rhodamine B, supporting additional food safety evaluations.\nPlasma Pharmacokinetics of Polyphenols in a Traditional Japanese Medicine, Jumihaidokuto, Which Suppresses Propionibacterium acnes-Induced Dermatitis in Rats\nFull Text Available Most orally administered polyphenols are metabolized, with very little absorbed as aglycones and/or unchanged forms.

"the study included the detailed method of job history classification for both cases and controls, and the use of well-defined coding systems. Results indicated an increased risk of PD with work experience in agriculture, fishing and forestry occupations, while experience in a service occupation was negatively associated with PD. This is the first case-control study to identify an inverse relationship between ever-working in the service industry and PD. Future studies should focus on validation of this protective effect among various populations, as well as the elevated risk of PD associated with agricultural industries. Attention to potential environmental exposures and common lifestyle factors within each occupational category is warranted.\n4. Manzo L, et al. Assessing effects of neurotoxic pollutants by biochemical markers. Environmental Research 85 : 31-36 (2001).\nThis article reviews the efficacy and limitations of current neurotoxicity biomarkers. Toxic biochemical changes often occur at the cellular/subcellular level before overt nervous system disease manifests. These changes may serve as markers of neurotoxicity in exposed populations. Complexity of nervous system functions, the multistage nature of neurotoxic events, and inaccessibility of target tissues pose obstacles to the use of biomarkers. However, new techniques have been established to assess exposure, effect and susceptibility to neurotoxic disease. Surrogate markers for nervous tissue are found in peripheral tissues. Presently, ALAD, AchE, and MAO are used as biomarkers of exposure to lead, organophosphates, and Mn/styrene respectively. The use of peripheral biomarkers is limited to agents whose mechanism of action is known, and is based upon the assumption that peripheral tissues have the same pharmacological properties as nervous system targets, and therefore are affected by neurotoxins in a similar way. This must be validated by mechanistic studies. Differences in dose-response and adaptation may occur. Markers detecting early neurotoxic changes may be effective as tools for identifying subclinical disease states and initial neurotoxic effects. Their development could play a critical role in occupational and preventative medicine. In combination with neurobe"

In return, she received not just a paycheck but also a share of the revenue from the program. She also became a popular teacher. Ann\u2019s classes \u201ccould be a riot of laughter from beginning to end. She had a great sense of humor,\u201d said Leonard Kibble, who taught part time at the institute in the early 1970s.

"growing. Phosphorus can be acquired from inorganic but natural sources such as rock phosphorus, or organic sources like bone meal. Soil pH needs to be below 7.0 for the phosphorus in bone meal to be available to plant roots.\nMany organic nutrients, such as bat guano and fish or chicken fertilizer, are high in phosphorus and have more rapid uptake profiles. Sea minerals and liquid seaweed are other organic sources of readily available phosphorus.\nSee: Soup Up Your Soil with Molasses, Guano, and Kelp\nThere are two primary categories for phosphorus availability: water soluble and citrate soluble. (You can find additional information on how phosphorus works, available sources, and how to improve plant uptake by following the link at the end of this article.)\nOrganic phosphorous fertilizers have been used for a very long time as the primary source for crops. Even with the advent of new phosphorous fertilizer technology, organic sources from animal manures\u2014including composts\u2014are still very important.\nFrom a fertilizer nutrient perspective, the primary difference is the availability of phosphorus from the fertilizer. As with most of the fertilizer products, especially those with varying analysis, additional chemical analysis should be done to determine an availability coefficient as a portion of the reported total phosphorus.\nSee: Organic Nutrients for a Sustainable Tomorrow\nPhosphorus contained in organic sources is a combination of inorganic and organic. Essentially, everything inorganic is in the orthophosphate form. The combination of the organic and inorganic phosphorous ratios in various organic sources and the soil environment will affect the availability for organic phosphorus.\nMost animal manure research interpretations indicate that approximately 60 to 80 per cent of the total phosphorus is available to crops in the first year. Due to the chemical composition of other organic sources, such as bone meal, lesser amounts of plant available phosphorus compared to total are expected.\nAn important consideration in nutrient safety is the quality and control of the manufacturer\u2019s process for producing the phosphorus in the fert"

This was a significantly shorter campaign than the previous one after a difficult year in terms of weather.\nIn the end, the forecasts issued by technical experts in the field came to pass and the productivity of the vines was limited by the adverse effects of Filomena in January, a situation that was exacerbated by some spring frosts, excessive heat in late August and violent storms and the occasional localised hailstorm in September, which reduced the quantity of the harvest but not the quality.

Massillon didn\u2019t allow Barberton a first down through first half, then came up with the big play at the right time in the second half to thwart a Magic rally.\n\u201cMassillon made some major adjustments defensively that helped them.\u201d Magic coach Rudy Sharkey said, \u201cThey were in a \u201c4\u20114\u201d most of the time, and we weren\u2019t really prepared for that.\u201d\nWhatever kind of defense it was, Sharkey said his team made it look good because of numerous offensive mistakes.\n\u201cWe continue to give away the ball every time we\u2019re on the football field Sharkey said, \u201cOf course, you have to give credit to Massillon, they\u2019re tough.

If so, it will be on their home turf.\nIt\u2019s easy to believe they should be able to get past a Caronlia team that finished below .500 in the regular season. Of course most Seahawks fans point to the fact that it was four years ago when Marshawn Lynch unleashed the Beast Quake and beat the defending Super Bowl Champion New Orleans Saints.\nThis is a bit different. The Panthers had their win in the Wild Card round at home already and they\u2019ll be playing on the Champs home turf. It\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t a chance, but as long as the Seahawks play up to the standard they\u2019ve set over the past six weeks, they should be able to take down any team in the league.\nThere was a huge demand for tickets and we\u2019re happy that we were able to get a few of you into the game Saturday night. The winner of the free tickets was selected last week and will be announced in Renton tomorrow. There were also a couple Military Sea Hawkers that will be coming in from out of town. We\u2019ll likely be announcing more info on our Facebook page once it\u2019s publicized.\nIf you\u2019re going to be at the game Saturday or in town and would like to tailgate, look for the club around 1531 Utah Ave. St. (aka Haw"
"only is Roulet guilty as charged, but he also may have been involved in an earlier murder which wrongfully sent one of Haller\u2019s former defendants to prison. Haller is helpless however, as attorney-client privilege prevents him from revealing what he knows. Cue the clever twists and turns and an intriguing game of attorney vs. client that pits Haller\u2019s wealth of investigative resources against Roulet\u2019s deep pockets. As a viewer, we feel equally invested in the proceedings. Can Haller rise to the challenge or is he just a legal hack who\u2019s in over his head? We\u2019re kept guessing as McConaughey\u2019s charisma fuels the excitement and danger of a case that seems to be spiraling out of control.\nA couple of missteps knock the film down a peg or two. Furman often tries to unnecessarily punch up the visuals with some gimmicky camera-work. He gets cutesy with a hand-held shaky cam trying to emphasize the film\u2019s frantic pace, but the plot is riveting enough without bringing attention to the visual style. A few too many tacked-on climaxes also manage to lessen the impact of the story\u2019s main payoff. A single conclusion would have worked better, but as it is, we\u2019re never quite sure when to let go.\nThese minor nits aside, The Lincoln Lawyer is a taut, suspenseful courtroom thriller worthy of mention alongside many of the genre greats. It\u2019s also a fascinating detective story filled with swarthy investigators, shady bail bondsmen, and palm-greasing lawyers. It\u2019s a welcome return to significance for McConaughey as well as for courtroom dramas.

"single command, so a full table or the entire database does not have to be encrypted. This protects against insider fraud by using secure keys that even the DBAs do not have access to.\n\"As more companies work with mobile software solutions, the need for robust security provisioning and encryption has spiraled,\" said Duncan Chapple, director of Lighthouse Analyst Relations. \"Sybase seems to have seen this coming and acquired Afaria to bring in mobile device management and mobile security some time ago now. These augmentations to Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) follow in the same vein. In real world deployments, this kind of technology must be secure, scalable and cross-platform if it is to be productive and profitable.\"\nAs with earlier versions, ASE encryption does not require changes to applications. Sybase ASE's optimizer takes into account column properties--whether a column is encrypted--when solving a query. This allows efficient storage retrieval and minimizes unnecessary data decryption. \"We have worked to give software developers the power to protect data without compromising performance and this is shown in the latest release of ASE,\" said Patrick Enright, director of developer relations for Sybase. \"The new features allow for fast responses when using system-level commands irrespective of the number of users. They also enable faster performance for creating and loading databases, even with tables having triggers and indexes.\"\nOther new features of ASE help to improve the productivity of application programmers. Since these functions are written in SQL, they can be readily incorporated within stored procedures without requiring developers to learn an additional programming language. Other enhancements include updatable views, four new statistical functions and an XML table function for better handling of unstructured text.\nThe new enhancements for encryption and security in ASE are available now on over 10 platforms including Windows.<s> Colin Henry Wilson, was born on June 26, 1931 in Leicester, England and died on December 5, 2013 after contracting pneumonia following a stroke that he suffered as a complication from spinal surgery.

The only difference is that it takes air for conditioning from additional air intakes where the air is then compressed using electric compressors instead of the engine.\nFigure 5 \u2013 External air sources in Boeing 787 [5].\nAdditional electrical generators on the engines supply the ECS power (hundreds of kilowatts) to drive the electrical compressors and electric heaters for de-icing (electro-thermal heater mats attached to the aircraft slats).

The Alphabet Inc. company said Wednesday that it plans next year to stop using or investing in tracking technologies that uniquely identify web users as they move from site to site across the internet. ... Google had already announced last year that it would remove the most widely used such tracking technology, called third-party cookies, in 2022.

As a professional athlete, whether he likes it or not, he is a role model for younger kids.\nIt's disappointing to me because KG is an amazing player who can win games through his outstanding play alone. He doesn't have to stoop down to such levels by attacking other player's family etc. (ex. Tim Duncan story). It sets a bad example to kids that they should do and say anything to win.\nHaving said that, I do feel that Melo's reaction was over the top (ex. waiting for KG outside his dressing room and bus). If you really think about it, KG's alleged statements that Melo's wife tasted like \"Honey Nut Cheerios\" is more of a joke...unless KG is saying it out of his own experience.

"of same.\nLast week I travelled on a morning service from Axminster to Exeter, early enough for it to be crowded with late commuters and early shoppers (like me). A young man was sitting alone in a table-for-four. He had placed himself on the aisle and had his feet on the seat opposite, effectively blocking access to the other two seats. Across the aisle was a \u2018mature\u2019 lady similarly spread across two seats from the aisle where her butt actually was. In the disabled area a young woman had filled the extra foot space with shopping bags and was sitting cross-legged on one seat, sideways, while she used the other seat as a cross between a social-media hub and office. The conductor came through asking for tickets, and said nothing. A community police officer came through and said nothing. It seems that those with the brass neck to \u2018claim\u2019 as much space as they want rely on the British reticence to cause a fuss and the fear of being embroiled in an altercation: people getting on further down the line passed by looking for a seat and opted to stand. I call this civic delinquency. If every seat had a fare paying bum in it wouldn\u2019t that help the capacity shortage?

In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event, including uncontrolled hypertension occurred in 2.2% of patients treated with aliskiren, versus 3.5% of patients given placebo. These data do not include information from the ALTITUDE study which evaluated the use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs [see Contraindications ( 4), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2), and Clinical Studies ( 14.4)].\nTwo cases of angioedema with respiratory symptoms were reported with aliskiren use in the clinical studies. Two other cases of periorbital edema without respiratory symptoms were reported as possible angioedema and resulted in discontinuation.

"have an exclusive arrangement with a lone distributor or may enter into multiple distribution agreements. Distribution agreements typically include trademark licensing terms, exclusivity or nonexclusivity provisions, marketing terms, descriptions of the geographic region covered and provisions for the length of the contract.\nTermination Clause and Negotiation\nThe easiest way to terminate a distribution agreement with minimal rancor is to include a termination clause that covers the basis for termination, the reason for termination, amount of required advance notice and any compensation either party must pay. The provisions must clearly specify termination dates -- for example, two years from today\u2019s date -- and whether or not the distribution agreement terminates upon breach of a particular term in the contract. If the agreement incorporates a \u201ctermination upon breach\u201d clause, that clause must also include clear details about what constitutes a breach, requirements regarding notices of breach and time to cure the breach.\nNegotiation in Absence of Termination Clause\nIf no termination clause and no serious contractual breach exist, the parties should attempt to negotiate a revision or amendment to the distribution agreement. Negotiating indicates that although circumstances have changed, the party initiating the amendment still values the relationship. Perhaps the distributor has not met sales targets or has not properly marketed the product. Or perhaps the distributor has a high number of product returns and customer complaints. Working as partners to address these issues increases the likelihood that a workable solution may appear. Even if a solution does not appear, the likelihood that the agreement terminates without escalating to attorney involvement and lawsuits increases.\nEnding the Agreement\nThe party that intends to terminate must provide as much notice as possible. Some states require as much as a 90-day notice in the absence of a specific termination clause. This protects a distributor who may have invested in marketing, sales force hires and warehouse space to service the manufacturer. If the terminating party is doing so because of poor performance or a shift in strategy, it should offer a financial remedy to the other to compensate. This could be a lump sum or a series of payments over time.\nAssociate of Corporate Counsel: Terminating Distribution Agreements -\u2013 Know Where You Stand\nKeeley"

"nine climate regions in the contiguous United States.\nThe CMAQ-Pollen modeling system was established to produce hourly concentrations of airborne pollen at 36\u2005km\u2009\u00d7\u200936\u2005km spatial resolution across the CONUS (28, 36). The configurations of model components are listed in Supplementary Table S2. The meteorological inputs are derived from climatological simulations performed using the Community Earth System Model (CESM), which was downscaled using the WRF model (40, 41). In the present study, we performed simulations for a historical year (\u201c2004\u201d) and for a future year (\u201c2047\u201d); the two years were selected as representative of the climatological conditions in the beginning and middle of the 21st century. It should be noted that the meteorological information in the simulations was not intended to exactly \u201cmatch\u201d these actual meteorological years, since the climatological simulations were performed without assimilating daily local weather observations (40). The pollen transport and fate model CMAQ-Pollen was adapted from version 4.7.1 of the CMAQ modeling system (42, 43). Pollen grains are treated as inert coarse mode aerosol and physical properties such as density, diameter and diameter distributions and other related information (e.g., cutoff maximum aerosol diameter) of the coarse mode are incorporated in the relevant CMAQ modules (AERO5), so that the CMAQ-Pollen model can properly describe pollen dynamics. Specifically, pollen grains are modeled by adding to the existing coarse mode and assuming it is fully mixed with other coarse aerosols (e.g., agricultural and wind-blown dust, sea spray). The CMAQ modules describe diameter of each coarse aerosol via a lognormal distribution (44). Due to data limitation, we assume the means of pollen diameters to be fixed (oak\u2009=\u200928\u2005\u03bcm and ragweed\u2009=\u200918\u2005\u03bcm for both historical and future years) and set relevant parameters (such as pollen density) the same as those used in our emission model (16).

The \u201crise\u201d of the family-focus of Christmas began in the 19thcentury in the US and other parts of the western world, with the \u201crise\u201d of the romantic idea of \u201cchildhood,\u201d and thus the rise of the toy industry at the turn of the 19th-20thcentury. Indeed, our modern concept of Santa Claus is a well-known 19th-20thcentury construction as well.\nThe modern family focus of modern, western Christmas is fascinating. Even though the \u201cmodern nuclear family\u201d has, for the most part, died in our modern world today, there are vestiges of it, in which many cleave to the notion that family is a mom, a dad, two children, and a pet or two, \u201cand they lived happily ever after.\u201d What is amazing when reading the story of the birth of Jesus from Matthew 1:18-25, it is apparent that the biblical family is anything but \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201csane.\u201d What I appreciate about reading Matthew 1:18-25 (which was the Gospel selection in the Revised Common Lectionary for the fourth Sunday of Advent), is that Joseph didn\u2019t quite know what to do about Mary and this unexpected, unexplained, unannounced pregnancy. And imagine Mary\u2019s surprise to be chosen by God! A young woman who was considered a refugee in an occupied land; an unwed teen who is pregnant. It is clear in Scripture that only God could save this messed up union, this about-to-fall-apart-couple, who are known as Mary and Joseph, who made it through the mess, and became known as the Holy Family. Praise be to God for a messy narrative about the birth of Jesus!\nThe reason I\u2019m glad for a messy narrative is because I, as a gay dad, often experienced Christmas as a messy time of year because of our family\u2019s narrative. This focus on the modern family in our celebration of Christmas has given us an opportunity to consider who or what family is included in the celebration of family, and which families are"
"But I didn\u2019t hate it. The other judges loved it. And I did like it better when I took a sip after eating one of the candies, which helped to check its overall sweetness. But there was no mistaking that this audacious drink looked beautiful in the glass.\nIn the end, the top three drinks were clear, and it came down to a one point game.\nThe watermelon drink that came in third place was made by Brandon John, who was actually the only student who works in the industry.

I had no idea the Capital Region had a league, but she says it\u2019s huge and a ton of fun.\nFirst prize went to Jen Manierre, for her restrained use of blood orange bitters and Domaine Canton in a twist on a very traditional whiskey sour.

The company also announced that its GAP8 Software Development Kit is now available for order.\nThe GAP8 IoT application processor, based on the RISC-V open source processor architecture, facilitates the cost-efficient development, deployment, as well as autonomous operation of intelligent sensing devices that record, examine, categorize, and work on the amalgamation of data sources like sounds, vibrations, or images. With an integrated 8-core computational cluster brought together with a convolution hardware accelerator, GAP8 is optimized to run a wide range of image and audio algorithms with high energy efficiency, the company added.\nFurthermore, an individual core, within an independent frequency and voltage domain, attends to control, information pre-analysis, and communication. This, in turn, enables consumer and industrial product manufacturers to integrate advanced classification and AI into new categories of wireless sensing devices for IoT applications including machine health monitoring, image recognition, speech recognition, home security, wearables, smart toys, and consumer robotics.\nLo\u00efc Li\u00e9tar, co-founder and CEO, GreenWaves Technologies, said, \u201cGAP8 differs radically from the flurry of other AI focused processors, which target either far more complex applications that can\u2019t be battery powered, or much narrower application spaces. Instead, GAP8 is precisely positioned at the crossroads of the AI, IoT and MCU worlds.

The machines used to complete the process are fewer; the labor hours needed are fewer too.\nSince it\u2019s possible to complete the job in three to five hours, it\u2019s an efficient process. Repairing a damaged pipe isn\u2019t a small task. Broken pipes cause serious property damage and create hazardous situations for households.\nA sewage backup into the toilet, drains, or floors are inconvenient. They\u2019re also dangerous and expensive to clean.\nProcess Extends the Life of a Pipe\nEvery major home appliance has a lifespan. If you keep the appliance according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommended settings and maintenance timeline, the manufacturer expects it to live a certain amount of time without any issues. A major appliance that fails within the warranty period is defective. Thus, most manufacturers replace without too much hassle to the consumer.\nPipes are major engineering feats. Even an Orangeburg pipe has a lifespan of 50 years. Cast iron, cement, and PVC pipes last between 75 to 100 years.\nSeptic systems consist of five components including the tank, drain lines, and pump. The septic lifespan depends on the component. The total system lasts up to 40 years. However, the tank lasts up to 20 years while the drain lines can last up to 40.\nSometimes a repair helps the appliance and the homeowner. Leaks in pipes are a warning sign. Opting for the lining repair option helps extend the life of the pipe. Keep in mind that a pipe needs to qualify for this repair first. If the plumbing professionals believe that it\u2019s beneficial, they\u2019ll recommend this procedure instead of a replacement.\nEpoxy pipe lining has a lifespan between 35 to 50 years. When it\u2019s successful, it expands the life of the pipe too.\nTo schedule Selden,NY pipe lining services, call Long Island Water and Sewer Main at 800-479-5325.

"of radiation therapy optimization. Faster MLC speed, dose rate, Gantry angle variation, and other degrees, which have been utilized in IMRT, IMAT, VMAT, improved modulation of intensity radiation ... [Show full abstract] that resulted in better quality in treatment plans. In this study, we modeled a pair of multi leaf collimators(MLC) to investigate ideal dynamical features such as speed and acceleration of MLC mathematically. Then we estimate an equation of MLC's motion in dynamical sliding window algorithm to investigate impact of some factors such as initial position of MLC, speeding up MLC, delivery time and variable dose rate on optimizing dose delivery algorithms. Materials and Methods: Seven intensity maps extracted from a prostate RT plan. MATLAB environment (R2017a version) was selected to define and solve optimization problem. In one dimension a pair of MLC modeled to reach out a row of intensity matrix diagram. Because of non concave nature of problem, gradient descent algorithm utilized and many criteria such as different start and end point of movement of MLC, direction of MLC, time delivery and dose rate subjected to optimization process. Results: Intensity map, velocity, acceleration, and output errors were plotted. However, the increase in the time can lead to a decrease in the error value - from 91% to an optimum of 2%; the error value did not reduce by increasing over optimum time significantly. Also increasing the speed of MLC's results in a significant reduction in relative error, although the assumption of the ability to reach out the infinite velocity does not lead to a reduction in relative error rate, and the optimization process was stopped. Conclusion: Although unidirectional movement in sliding window algorithm demonstrates as a suboptimal method, in volumetric methods bidirectional movement could have been optimal. Although that seems to get better outcome by speeding up MLC, it\u2019s not as a rule routinely and infinite speed have been result in stopping optimization prematurely. In higher speed, we don\u2019t see the linear relationship mathematically and over speeding up may lead to more anarchy in MLC movements reality. Not only increasing time delivery dose after a certain limit did not cause to significant decrease in optimization error, but also it may lead to other errors, and trade of between time and quality should"

". Parashurama Avatar is stated to be such.\nAvatars are countless\nSrimad Bhagavatam also states that Avatars are countless. Such a statement too is logical considering the fact that Puranas were written thousands of years ago. Naturally, more Avatars coming to earth is quite in order because Avatars, by definition come to earth whenever dharma is in danger and the wicked and evil forces are in the rise. Avatars do come to show the right path of dharma suited to changing times.\nAvatara Purushas\nThus in Hinduism, ardent devotees hail several Mahatma\u2019s of later periods as Avatara Purushas. Their lives and teachings too become extremely important as puranas and scriptures. Unlike old puranas and shastras that are in Sanskrit language, the Avatara Purushas give teachings in their local languages and their teachings are far more simpler to comprehend and to put to practice in life because they are in tune with the needs of the time. Invariably, their teachings are totally in resonance with the different aspects of scriptures.\nShri Shankaracharya is hailed as an Avatar of Lord Shiva\nSri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is hailed as an Avatar of Radha.\nSri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is considered a divine Avatar with Devi\u2019s amsa.\nShirdi Saibaba is considered an Avatar of God, whose appeal broke the barriers of Hindus and Muslims\nSri Satya Saibaba is considered an Avatar of Shiva-Shakti\nSwami Vivekananda is hailed as an Avatar of Shiva by some of his guru bhais and devotees.\nBhagwan Ramana Maharshi \u2013 though he is a Purna Jnani (who is beyond the concept of Avatars) , there are some devotees who consider him an Avatar of Lord Subrahmanya.\nMata Amritanandamayi (Amma) is considered an the Avatar of Devi Parashakti.\nOne commonly observed feature amidst these Avatara Purushas is that even though they may appear to follow a specific religious path"

We\u2019ll start with technology, which is perhaps the most significant part of every golf club nowadays.\nThe XE1 Wedge\u2019s core technology emphasizes forgiveness. The XE1\u2019s technology sets it different. High loft and auto-glide sole make chipping easy.\nThe head is heavier than a regular wedge, making it easier to align before, during, and after the swing. There\u2019s also heel-to-toe weighing, which is lower and more forgiving.\nIt\u2019s not as high-tech as a CBX wedge. Ahead of its competition, the XE1 Wedge used cutting-edge technology.\nThe X1 Wedge excels with forgiveness, making it an ideal sand wedge for newbies. This Wedge can \u201ceradicate fat pitches and chips,\u201d as stated.\nXE1 Wedge\u2019s sweet spot is huge due to two important factors.\nAs a result, the sweet spot is widened.\nSecond, the heel-toe weighting is extra-large, dispersing the clubface\u2019s center of gravity. This makes mishitting with the XE1 Wedge very tough.\nChip shots are easy and consistent with a 59 or 65-degree loft angle and an auto glide sole.\n59\u00b0Loft Option Option 2: 165\u00b0Loft\nHowever, compared to most wedges on"

"in Libya \u2013 the millions of demonstrators \u2013 \u201cwant to turn Libya into an Islamic state\u201d is exactly the same nonsense that Mubarak peddled before the end in Egypt, the very same nonsense that Obama and La Clinton have suggested. Indeed, there were times last night when Gaddafi \u2013 in his vengefulness, his contempt for Arabs, for his own people \u2013 began to sound very like the speeches of Benjamin Netanyahu. Was there some contact between these two rogues, one wondered, that we didn\u2019t know about?\nIn many ways, Gaddafi\u2019s ravings were those of an old man, his fantasies about his enemies \u2013 \u201crats who have taken tablets\u201d who included \u201cagents of Bin Laden\u201d \u2013 were as disorganised as the scribbled notes on the piece of paper he held in his right hand, let alone the green-covered volume of laws from which he kept quoting.

Having kept the international media \u2013 the \u201cdogs\u201d in question \u2013 out of Libya, he allowed the world to observe a crazed nation: YouTube and blogs of terrible violence versus state television pictures of an entirely unhinged dictator justifying what he had either not seen on YouTube or hadn\u2019t been shown. And there\u2019s an interesting question here: dictators and princes who let the international press into their countries \u2013 Messrs Ben Ali/Mubarak/Saleh/Prince Salman \u2013 are permitting it to film their own humiliation.

"is one of the strangest tales ever told. It deals with the two great mysteries of creation: life and death. I think it will thrill you. It may shock you. It might even horrify you. So if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain, now is your chance to, uh\u2026 Well, we\u2019ve warned you.\nI have always loved this film, but I enjoy The Bride of Frankenstein more. I will get more into why that is later.\nThis movie is terrifying as we see Frankenstein becomes consumed with creating his being/his creation. He won\u2019t listen to anyone else and his behavior frightening his friends, family, and fianc\u00e9.\nLet me just clarify for everyone out there that the name Frankenstein alludes to Victor Frankenstein, the mad doctor who creates the Monster. For some reason they changed his name in the film to Henry, while making his best friend Victor (while in the book his friend\u2019s name is Henry. Why? Go figure.) The Monster is never called by a name other than Monster, Creature, or something similar. It\u2019s like The Creature from the Black Lagoon or The Thing from Another World, no proper names are given. People call it Frankenstein and while that isn\u2019t technically correct, Frankenstein did create him so I will accept Frankenstein Jr.\nAnyways, he is helped out by a hunchback named Fritz\nNot Igor, FRITZ!\nThe hunchback named Igor who helps mad scientists isn\u2019t from the original Frankenstein, but comes from one of the sequels, Son of Frankenstein, where his name was Ygor; later translated to Igor. So there\u2019s a fun bit of trivia for you, Fritz is the first Frankenstein minion/employee not Igor.\nAnyways, Fritz is the one who makes the mistake of stealing the criminal brain.\nFrom Clueless\nSo while in the novel, Shelley never tells us how it the creature is brought to life done, as Frankenstein never wanted to share the details of the experiment for fear that someone would create their own living dead. With nothing to go off of, the writers and directors decided to use lightening, and therefore changed film culture and"
"Croxall et al., 1991; Wanless et al., 1993). The reality is likely to be twofold: (i) intervals at the surface between dives nominally comprise a recovery period from the previous dive and a preparation for the dive to come, and (ii) we may, in any case, be erring in attempting to derive body oxygen norms on the basis of data obtained for resting animals. Clearly, non-exercising animals with virtually unlimited access to oxygen will have higher body oxygen concentrations than animals with high energy expenditure and limited access to oxygen. A similar parallel may be drawn using carbon dioxide. There is no obvious disadvantage to working with lower body oxygen concentrations apart from the question of reserves, and indeed Kramer's premise indicates that there is much to be gained by so doing(Kramer, 1988). Ultimately,the higher the PO2 gradient within and between tissues and inhaled air, the more rapidly oxygen will move into the tissues.\nAlthough a great deal is known about the process of gas exchange in diving marine endotherms (e.g. Butler and Jones,1997), there are few data that might illuminate the utility of different gas-exchange strategies on genuinely free-living animals (but see Le Boeuf et al., 2000), due to the logistic difficulties of this type of study. We used a new type of logger(Wilson et al., 2002) to quantify voluntary breathing patterns in captive Humboldt penguins Spheniscus humboldti and free-living, foraging Magellanic penguins S. magellanicus, in order to improve our understanding of respiration during surface intervals between dives. Acquired data were examined using a simple model to determine the extent to which rates of gas exchange might be affected and enhanced by observed breath frequency and derived tidal volume data.\nWork was conducted on nine captive Humboldt penguins Spheniscus humboldti Meyen in the marine facility at the University Cato\u0301lica del Norte in Coquimbo, Chile.

Malik, Christian T. Byrnes, Ki-Young Choi\nAbstract: In this paper we analyse three models of the early universe, for which the respective mechanisms for generating the curvature perturbation are considered disparate. We find that in fact the mechanisms are very similar, and hence explain why they give rise to a large non-gaussianity. We show that the mechanism for generating the primordial curvature perturbation, and hence the observable non-gaussianity, is similar in both the Curvaton and Modulated Reheating models."

Furthermore, there were concerns about the administration costs of the system. A process was set in place, announced by Gordon Brown, to replace the existing RAE (after the 2008 exercise) with a simpler metrics-based system. As detailed at length in Sayer, despite major consultations involving many important parts of the UK academic establishment, an initial report and proposals of this type were quickly changed to a two-track model of metrics and peer review, then the whole plan was almost completely abandoned.\nRAE 2008 itself had fewer major changes. Amongst these were a renewed set of assessment criteria, especially as affected applied, practice-based and interdisciplinary research, a two-tiered panel structure, with sub-panels undertaking the detailed assessment and making recommendations to main panels, who made broader decisions and produced a \u2018quality profile\u2019 for a department, in place of the older seven-point system.

"mg/kg bw). Such increase of 9CDHROL after 9CDHROL treatment was also significant, but less pronounced in the brain (ca. 90-fold increase, Fig. 2A and B) and not observable in the serum, pointing to tissue specific biodistribution and/or accumulation. ATROL levels following treatment with equivalent amounts of ATROL just increased in the brain (Fig. 2E), suggesting an important function and requirement of vitamin A1 in the brain [17, 18]. Serum and liver ATROL levels were not significantly altered 11 hrs after treatment, supporting a dynamic homeostatic regulation in the blood and liver [19, 20]. It was striking, however, that despite single treatment with high dose of 9CDHROL the liver levels of 9CDHROL were ca. 15-times lower than basal ATROL levels (compare Figs. 2B and 2E). In contrast, 9CDHROL levels in the brain after 9CDHROL treatment easily reach an equivalent range level like the endogenous physiological levels of ATROL (compared to our own data shown in Figs. 2B and 2E), pointing towards an important function and selective requirement of 9CDHROL and further RXR-mediated signaling in the brain. Importantly, we did not detect any increase of 9CDHROL levels after ATROL treatment (Fig. 2B) or inversely an increase of ATROL levels after 9CDHROL treatment (Fig. 2E) in the plasma, liver or brain, indicating that direct interconversion of these two retinoid structures is not possible or is highly limited in physiological conditions in vivo. However, some conversion or biological feedback may appear in specific cell types, which is supported by weak, but significant increase of 9CDHROL levels after in vitro treatment with ATROL of 158N oligodendrocytes (Fig. 2F, G).\nThe vitamin A5/X concept: 9CDHROL, but not ATROL is an efficient precursor of 9CDHRA in mice\n"
"is a good point in the post: disgust is not reliable. You should be prepared to examine your \"yuck\" reactions. Philosophers are right to insist on this.\nBut then what? If you examine them, some will go away. Fine. Why act on reactions that are transient? Some will not go away, but you will take them much less seriously and so (reasonably) decide to quarantine them so they don't affect your judgment. But some yuck reactions are persistent, and don't want to be quarantined. A hyperationalist doesn't like these either. If you can't explain, you must abstain. That's the basic idea.\nI don't know about that. The suppression of \"yuck\" reactions contrasts sharply with the way philosophers treat their own \"intuitions.\" If you have a very strong intuition that the fat man can't be pushed in front of the trolley to save the five, that's \"data\"! It's par for the course to take such reactions very, very seriously.\nWhy so little respect for gut reactions that are tinged by feeling (squidophilia, eww!), and so much respect for non-visceral intuitions (push fat guy, no)?

"0.5=0.0625. After approximately 107 attempts the probability of success is P=0.999, which for our purpose is effectively deterministic.\nc.2 Nv\u2212 module\nLet us now return to the issue of errors in the module. Error can be divided into two categories:\nAccumulation errors are those that depend on the number of attempts taken to establish entanglement between remote electron spins. These errors only affect the error rate of the nuclear\u2013nuclear CPHASE gate, not the error rate of nuclear measurement and initialisation. To tolerate a low success probability (which necessitates a large number of attempts) these errors need to be heavily suppressed.\nNon-accumulation errors are those that are independent of the total number of attempts, and depend only on the final successful attempt to establish entanglement between remote electron spins.\nIn Sections III and IV we will break down errors into several parameters that determine the overall error rates of nuclear spin measurement and initialisation CPHASE gates between remote nuclear spins. These error rates will then allow us to determine the performance of the architecture.\nAppendix D Nuclear Spin measurement and initialisation\nBoth measurement and initialisation of the nuclear qubit is performed via projective collapse of the electron and the hyperfine interaction. As described in everitt2012 we can generate multiple types of controlled operations (where the electron acts as the control) between the electron\u2013nuclear system. The most basic is the natural hyperfine generated CPHASE gate. Combining this with Y rotations on the electron, we are able to perform an effective Z-basis measurement on the nucleus with a total time of approximately 2\u00d75+165+100=275 ns, assuming single-qubit gates take less than 5 ns and single attempt initialisation and measurement of the electron takes 100 ns (see Fig. 11a). This measurement circuit also initialises the nucleus in a known state. Therefore, measurement and initialisation in this model is achieved with a combined gate.\nSimilarly, we can drive the hyperfine interaction to generate a controlled rotation around a different axis (rather than the Z axis). Two examples are a controlled-not (CNOT) operation and a controlled-Y operation, which can be used to measure the nucleus"

And now Hader may have peaked, although the postseason suggests otherwise.\nI think I might be in the minority on this but I really disagree with \"unquestionably a Hall of Famer.\" I think he probably is.

It didn\u2019t turn up in my internet research, but when I went to work a few days ago (at a bookstore), the children\u2019s book director had set this aside for me! And it was love at first sight.

In terms of Native American self-determination and sovereignty, what does freedom of the press mean for Native American nations? What about Native government owned (and sometimes controlled) media and the right to tell critical stories about tribal council members without being penalized? What does Native American journalism look like both within and outside of Native American nations?

She\u2019s a reporter for Mvskoke Media in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, and she wants to give her readers access to all the information relevant to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. But that\u2019s not an easy task, given that Angel and her colleagues believe in truth and transparency and aren't afraid to challenge the integrity of some questionable tribal officials.

The global pandemic and unrest of the year will stick with customers for the long term and greatly influence how they interact with companies going forward. With more virtual events and interactions than ever before, customers want human connection.\nThe 2021 Deloitte Global Marketing Trends Report highlights seven trends shaping customer experience and business growth in 2021: Purpose, Agility, Trust, Talent, Participation, Fusion and Human Experience. Understanding these trends can help brands drive connection and engagement.\nAlthough each trend is unique and stands on its own, Deloitte CMO Suzanne Kounkel says the trends also work together to support and influence each other. A company that has built strong trust will also likely have a strong sense of participation, for example, while a company lacking in trust likely won\u2019t have as strong of customer participation or human experience.\nOf the seven trends, Kounkel says the most important may be purpose and"

"confident that it was just a blip and that sales would climb to new highs once warmer weather arrived.\nRecently, investors have received some good news in that regard. On June 5, Electrek reported that Tesla had delivered 33,000 vehicles in North America alone since the beginning of April, based on leaked information from a company insider. Tesla hopes to deliver another 33,000 in North America in June, according to Electrek. Even if that June goal proves unrealistic, Tesla still has a decent chance of surpassing 90,000 deliveries globally this quarter.\nTesla may be able to set a new record for vehicle deliveries this quarter. Image source: Tesla.\nWall Street analysts -- who may be a more neutral source of information -- agree that Tesla has seen a rebound in sales and deliveries. \"More Model 3s were registered in April and May than during all of the first quarter,\" wrote analysts at JMP Securities (via CNBC). Widely followed analyst Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley concurred, estimating that Tesla sold 11,300 vehicles in the U.S. last month.\nWhile there's a range of estimates about Tesla's orders and deliveries for the past two months, it seems clear that conditions have improved dramatically compared to last quarter. That said, this rebound may be short-lived.\nTiming factors have boosted deliveries this quarter\nTesla's apparent jump in deliveries in April and May was driven by two unusual factors.\nFirst, Tesla had about 10,600 vehicles in transit to customers at the end of last quarter, compared to fewer than 3,000 a quarter earlier. This total included many vehicles bound for customers in North America, due to the automaker's effort to deliver a massive number of cars in the last few days of the first quarter. Those vehicles were delivered in April instead. Had Tesla been able to squeeze in those deliveries during March as planned, the first quarter would have looked slightly less awful, but there wouldn't have been a surge in deliveries in April.\nSecond, Tesla finally began deliveries of the Model "

After an elbow injury and a few bad mistakes derailed what could have been an unstoppable season for Josh, he\u2019s once again amongst the NFL\u2019s elites competing for the league\u2019s most prestigious individual award. But, our beloved Buffalo Bills quarterback isn\u2019t the favourite just yet. The race is one of the closest in recent memory, and it will come down to the wire.\nAP Photo/Steven Senne\nThe Other Candidates\nCurrently, there are three other players with reasonable expectations to compete for the MVP. It\u2019s a quarterback game as every MVP since 2012 has played that most critical position, so it\u2019s expected that the leading candidates would all play it too. Sorry Justin Jefferson, this season is incredible but the best you can do is Offensive Player of the Year. (You will absolutely get it.)\nAs far as statistics go, the race is very close. The three main contributors to an MVP\u2019s stat-line are ball security, scoring, and yardage. How often do they score, how much of their offense is them moving the ball, and do they make those critical mistakes?\nSecondly, and perhaps most importantly of all, is the story. The MVP is not an objective award. The tale is as important as the play on the field, and there are some incredible stories this season. From personal battles to winning the big games, it\u2019s what we feel that matters.\nLet\u2019s take a look at Josh Allen\u2019s competition for 2022/23.\nJalen Hurts \u2013 Philadelphia Eagles (13-2)\nPer Game (14)\nTotal Yards 4219 301.4\nTotal TDs 35 (22+13) 2.5\nINTs 5 0.36\nStats Per PFR\nJalen Hurts has been one of the most entertaining quarterbacks in the NFL this season, The Eagles are 13-"
"Work\nWhen men ask more questions: a glimpse of ordinary sexism in the academic world.\nMen ask more questions then women in academic conferences and are more visible. Roads Academy Masterclass, Warwick University, November 2010.\nHA1-000602/Flickr, CC BY-SA\nAlecia Carter, Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier\nIt\u2019s a man\u2019s world when it comes to work: women are paid 20% less than men; men with equivalent experience are promoted over women; women with children are hired less, while men with children are paid more; successful women are viewed as less likeable than successful men. Although conditions for women have improved compared to several decades ago, the rate of improvement has slowed in recent years, suggesting that gender bias in the workplace will persist for a long time to come.\nAcademia is not immune to sexism\nIn Academia, women acquire 59% of undergraduate degrees, but only 21% of senior faculty positions, an observation frequently referred to as the \u201cleaky pipeline\u201d. Many factors have been proposed to explain the attrition of women as academic career progress, including innate differences in ability; differences in the career preferences of men and women; parenting; differences in the assessment of women\u2019s CVs for hiring, tenure and promotion; differences in males\u2019 and females\u2019 salaries for equivalent positions; imposter syndrome; and a lack of appropriate role models and mentors for women. However it happens, the result is low visibility of successful women in academic science.\nWhy should we be concerned about this gender imbalance in visibility? Much evidence suggests that having models that one can identify with is important to how people perceive their possibility for success in any given career.\nWomen are less visible\nThat there is an imbalance in men and women\u2019s visibility thus poses a problem in the context of the wider issue of the attrition of women in academia. Unfortunately, women are not only less visible than men in terms of later-stage career positions, but they are disproportionately less visible in other spheres of academia, too.\nFor example, men are more likely to hold more \u201cprestigious\u201d first or last authorship on papers; men\u2019s papers are cited more frequently than women\u2019s; men give dis"
", an extinct watercourse that is not extinct, we are told, but only dormant, dreaming beneath the asphalt and concrete.\nSo much for the first, wonder-exciting section of SHORE in NARRM, presented by Arts House as part of the Yirramboi First Nations Arts Festival. Although it\u2019s only a prelude to the main event, the guided walk from the park through the cobbled laneways does much to channel the mysteries of night and to convey a sense of congregation. The second section, however, inside the main hall at the North Melbourne Town Hall, is less compelling.\nAgain, we have a large cast of performers, including a choir led by Margot Bassett Silver and Indigenous-Australian singer-songwriter Maylene Slater-Burns. And again Johnson is at the centre, supported by dancers Ben Hurly and Jacqueline Aylward. Here the choreography is muscular and clean, with fierce lunges, swinging arms and long strides punctuated by juddering steps. This is authentic American modern dance, complete with bright retro-futurist costumes and stylised references to contemporary popular moves.\nSHORE, Emily Johnson, Yirramboi, photo courtesy the artists\nAnd yet there are many other parts to this performance besides dance that Johnson insists are also dance. At one point, for instance, we hear a collage of television commentary from the 1991 NBA play-offs between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Chicago Bulls. Dressed in high school sports kit, a cast member slowly moves centrestage, stands and stares out into the audience. After a few minutes, on a signal from Johnson, the audio cuts out and the cast member drifts back into the crowd. At another moment, Johnson performs a series of handstands off a long run-up. The choir sings, pot plants are shifted around the stage by smiling cast members and snow jackets are distributed.\nWhat do these and other similarly cryptic moments and props signify? On what level are they connected? On what principle are they organised? Again there is the feeling that Johnson is gesturing beyond this time and place, back to her experiences growing up in Alaska or studying in"

"\nAccording to Nikita, the first time her baby daddy hit her, she got a restraining order against him.\nRead next: Inside Mampho Brescia's Vow Renewal\nPicture credit: Instagram<s> Book Review: Geekerella by Ashley Poston\nGeekerella is about an orphaned girl, living with her stepmother and stepsisters, who is badly treated by them (what do you mean, you guessed that from the title?). One of the few things she has left in her life which she really finds comfort in is the classic sci-fi series Starfield, which she loved watching with her father. So when teen heartthrob Darien Freeman is cast as lead character Carmindor in the new movie of the show, she's incensed, and doesn't hold back from saying so on her blog. Despite this, after finding her parents' old Starfleet costumes, she becomes desperate to win the cosplay contest at a convention her dad helped found to make her parents proud. Meanwhile, she answers a message Darien sends to her dad's e-mail address without knowing who he is, and the pair strike up an unlikely friendship via texts.\nI've seen lots of people talking about this one and bought it a while ago on ebook but somehow hadn't got around to reading it - what a mistake! The central pair here are super cute characters who I adored - shy superfan Elle, desperately trying to deal with an awful family situation and still missing the father she was so close to, is an instantly likeable character, while Darien is impressively well-written as a massive Starfleet fan in his own right who's both nervous about taking over a role from an actor he deeply admires, and sad that he's forced to hide his love for the series because it doesn't fit into the image his father, who manages his career, wants for him. On the one hand, both Darien's father and Elle's stepmother are fairly horrible characters; on the other hand once I reached the end of the book it was clear why they were acting the way they did, with Elle's stepmother getting more of a reason for her behaviour than I've generally seen in many Cinderella retellings I've read.

Several biomarkers such as S-phase fractions and vascular endothelial growth factor expression have been evaluated in this regard (7,8). Kr\u00fcppel-like factors (KLFs) are a family of evolutionarily conserved mammalian zinc finger transcription factors named for their homology with Kr\u00fcppel, a Drosophilia melanogaster protein (9). KLFs are involved in a diverse array of fundamental biological processes including proliferation, differentiation, development, and apoptosis (10\u201312). Among the KLF family, the Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 (KLF4; also called gut-enriched Kr\u00fcppel-like factor or GKLF) was one of the first identified (13,14). In addition to regulating many important physiologic processes, KLF4 has been shown to play a role in pathological conditions such as cancer and inflammation (15\u201320). More recently, KLF4 was shown to play a crucial role in the reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (21\u201325).\nExpression of KLF4 is enriched in epithelial tissues including the gut (13,14). In the intestine, KLF4 is highly expressed in the postmitotic, terminally differentiated epithelial cells at the luminal surface (26,27). In vitro, KLF4 inhibits proliferation by blocking cell cycle progression at the G1/S boundary (28). In addition, KLF4 mediates the cell cycle checkpoint functions of the tumor suppressor p53 following DNA damage (29\u201331). Moreover, loss of expression of KLF4 due to several reasons including loss of heterozygosity, promoter hypermethylation, and loss-of-function mutations has been documented in a small set of colorectal cancer specimens (3"

Printed on fine bond paper, it stated that he had graduated from Oxford University\u2019s Polytechnic School of Engineering, listing specialties in a huge range of disciplines, including geology, physics, electrical engineering, civil engineering, and mathematics. He adorned it with official-looking seals and forged signatures. He then carried the fabrication to the very pinnacle of legitimacy-lending institutions: The local notary. This particular notary was not as rigorous as some, and Alves Reis seemed like an upstanding gentleman. So the public official helpfully stamped and signed the document, thereby certifying its authenticity\u2060\u2060\u2014nevermind that Oxford University had no \u201cPolytechnic School of Engineering\u201d.\nWith these manufactured credentials and his superhuman charm, Alves Reis soon secured a high ranking position in the Angolan capital Luanda, overseeing plans for buildings and sewers for the Department of Public Works.

He quickly earned the respect of his fellow railroad workers\u2060\u2060\u2014unlike other supervisors, who kept their distance from the greasy and sooty railroad engines, he was willing to get his hands dirty in the railyard, climbing around to help diagnose mechanical problems.

The unit of currency in Portugal and Angola at the time was the escudo, and Alves Reis had amassed more than 600,000 escudos (worth roughly $500,000 adjusted for US dollars in 2022).

(Kekistan is the fictional country adopted by alt-right trolls.)\nOn its face, the plan and its execution leave something to be desired; anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the difference between, say, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton would be able to sniff out a fraud. But /pol/ isn\u2019t trying to pass the smell test with leftists. Instead, they\u2019re banking on the inevitability of Poe\u2019s Law: the idea that unless satire is explicitly labeled as such, there will always be those who believe it to be true.\nThe larger question is, what is the point of this? The answer varies from person to person. For some, the purpose is political: they despise the left and want progressive policies to fail. If those policies fail because Democrats can\u2019t retake Congress, great; if they fail because the general public believes that supporting Democratic candidates is a losing proposition, so much the better. For others, the politics of it all are beside the point; they merely want to stir up some shit and make people angry. The act of trolling is its own justification.\nThus far, the #NoMenMidterms hashtag hasn\u2019t taken off, and analytics show its use has declined since the initial spike.

FLAME University<s> Acustica update Erin plug-in suite\nNew compressors powered by Hyper engine\nAcustica Audio have released an update for Erin, their dedicated mastering plug-in suite. Two new processors have been introduced, bringing the total count to five, along with a range of other optimisations and improvements such as scaleable GUI options.\nNew Hyper Comps\nIn addition to the existing plug-ins, two new processors based on Acustica\u2019s new Hyper compression technology have been added to Erin, in the form of Mono Hyper Comp and Stereo Hyper Comp. As the name implies, one of these compressors operates in mono whilst the second is designed for treating stereo sources.\nWith the company\u2019s standard compressors, gain reduction, attack, and release curves are not calculated for every sample but for every 'n' samples, where 'n' depends on the sample rate. Acustica say that this can result in signals with fast transients not being compressed in time, with the transient \u201cescaping\u201d compression.\nThe Hyper technology allows the new processors to calculate gain reduction, attack, and release curves at each sample, with compression being applied immediately as a result. The speed of the new compressors can also be further increased by the use of oversampling, all whilst still using significantly less CPU than their predecessors.\nExisting Processors\nErin Stereo Tube EQ\nThe Erin EQ ST is a faithful emulation of an esoteric 5-band stereo parametric equaliser mainly used in mastering facilities, of which Acustica sourced and carefully sampled an immaculate unit. The EQ features five bands: high and low-shelf filters with gain and fixed Q controls, as well as three boost/cut filters with an adjustable centre frequency. Dedicated buttons allow the preamp section and each individual band to be bypassed.\nErin Mid EQ\nErin EQ MID is an emulation of a UK-made Pultec-style tube equaliser unit. Designed specifically for use on the mid-range, the processor focuses on frequencies from 200Hz to 5kHz. It features a limited number of selectable frequencies, which have"

"destruction in RA, we examined the effects of scopoletin on FLS apoptosis. Primary FLS from adjuvant arthritis rats were purified and cultured, and then treated with increasing concentrations of scopoletin (250, 500, 1,000 \u03bcM) for 24 h. Scopoletin decreased the viability of FLS in a dose-dependent manner and remarkably induced their apoptosis, as revealed by Hochest 33258 staining and flow cytometry analysis. Further experiments showed that scopoletin activated caspase-3, depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, regulated expression of bcl-2 family members, and reduced the activation of NF-\u03baB proteins. These results indicated that scopoletin induced apoptosis of FLS through a mitochondrial-dependent pathway, which may be mediated by inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation and promotion of caspase-3 activation.\nAB - Scopoletin is a naturally occurring coumarin compound found in many medicinal plants, such as Erycibe obtusifolia Benth and Aster tataricus. Our previous studies have demonstrated that this compound could ameliorate adjuvant-induced arthritis in a rat model of human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Since the proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) plays a pivotal role in the formation and growth of pannus, which leads to subsequent joint destruction in RA, we examined the effects of scopoletin on FLS apoptosis. Primary FLS from adjuvant arthritis rats were purified and cultured, and then treated with increasing concentrations of scopoletin (250, 500, 1,000 \u03bcM) for 24 h.

"-1\u03b2 and IL-18, into their mature forms which are then secreted from cells. In addition to CASP-1, some other inflammatory caspases, e.g. CASP-4, CASP-5 and CASP-12, can also process the proforms of these cytokine [16,20]. In general, the expression levels of NLRP3 receptor as well as the precursors of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 remain low and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes requires a priming phase while the expression of these proteins is clearly induced [17,21,22]. Interestingly, NF-\u03baB signaling is a crucial inducer of NLRP3 expression [21]. It should be noted that different cellular stresses and the aging process can stimulate NF-\u03baB signaling [11,23] and probably enhance the priming and potentiation of the inflammasome activation.\nInfections and tissue injuries can trigger an inflammatory reaction as a physiological host defence mechanism but in addition, cellular stress can also alert the immune system and induce adaptive responses. This kind of inflammation was termed \u201cpara-inflammation\u201d by Medzhitov [24]. Recent studies have revealed that NLRP3 is the major receptor for endogenous danger insults to facilitate inflammatory responses. Petrilli et al. [25] demonstrated that the efflux of potassium, an effect evoked by many noxious stimuli, could activate NLRP3 inflammasomes. After this initial observation, several different activation mechanisms have been identified but still there is an ongoing debate about whether they are physiological inducers and what kind of responses they stimulate. The increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by oxidative stress was one of the first stimuli which was demonstrated to trigger NLRP3 activation and promote CASP-1-dependent IL-1\u03b2 secretion [26,27]. Furthermore, several studies have indicated that the release of cathepsin B after lysosomal damage can activate NLRP3 [28,29]. Lys"

"able solution which resulted in a key series of IETF standards defining DNS. See RFC 1034 and RFC 1035, which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.\nDNS today is a distributed database spread over many computer servers located worldwide. The database is organized around the concept of domain names (e.g., \u201c.com\u201d is part of a domain name, and \u201cwww.bestcompany.com\u201d is a FQDN). Each domain name is essentially a path in a large inverted tree, called the domain namespace (see FIG. 1). A domain is a sub-tree of the entire space. The tree structure has a single (logical) root at the top. The depth of the tree is limited to 127 levels. Each node in the tree has a text label name that can be up to 63 characters long. Domain names are always read from the leaf node toward the root with dots separating the names in the path. So, for example for the FQDN \u201cwww.bestcompany.com\u201d, the \u201c.com\u201d would be at the top of the tree and is referred to as the Top Level Domain (TLD). Then \u201c.bestcompany\u201d would be next down the tree, and \u201cwww\u201d would be at the bottom leaf of the tree.\nAs mentioned previously, DNS database entries are stored in a format called RRs. The RRs are organized by domains or specific domain names (FQDNs). FQDNS are ultimately associated with a physical network device, while domains (e.g., \u201c.com\u201d) are used to identify a group of devices. There are various types of RRs classified by the type of information related to the device that they contain. Some exemplary DNS RRs are listed in Table 1.\nTypes of DNS Resource Records (RRs)\nType of RR Name Description A Address Record The IPv4 address of the host (device) for the given FQDN AAAA IPv6 Address Record The IPv6 address of the host (device) for the given FQDN MX Mail Exchange Record The E-Mail Exchange server for a given domain NS Name Server Record The authoritative DNS name server for the given domain PTR Pointer Record A pointer to another part of the DNS name space (Often used to map an IP address to a host name) SR"

The increase in antibody response in seronegative and seropositive patients demonstrated a preserved response to novel and recall antigens. This is the first time this could be shown with a BTK inhibitor in RMS and these findings are consistent with the modulation of B cell function, providing a potentially alternative treatment to B cell depletion approaches.\nFor more information, contact Alice McGrail\nAbout Evobrutinib\nEvobrutinib is an oral, CNS-penetrating, highly selective inhibitor of Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) in clinical development as a potential treatment for relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). It is the first BTK inhibitor to demonstrate clinical efficacy in the largest Phase II study with follow-up beyond three years as well as demonstrate an impact on early biomarkers of ongoing central inflammation that correlate with disease progression, including slowly expanding lesions (SEL) volume and levels of blood neurofilament light chain protein (NfL). Evobrutinib is designed to modulate B cell responses such as proliferation and antibody and cytokine release, as well as modulate macrophage/microglia activation. During Phase II, the BTKi dose finding study demonstrated that BID dosing achieved maximal efficacy with >95% BTK occupancy maintained in 98% of patients before the next dose. Evobrutinib is currently under clinical investigation and is not approved for any use anywhere in the world.\nAbout the Open-Label Extension (OLE) Phase II Clinical Trial\nIn the 48 week"
"simplicity: all it takes is to put one\u2019s trust in God. It is a deliberate ploy to dissipate the gloom and terror\u2014like opening a window in a smoke-filled room.\u201d\nThe Fullness of Glory\nTo become as little children, however, might be an uncongenial directive for 21st-century men of complicated belief, or unbelief, who would rather think of themselves as having put away childish things. The cantata Ich habe genug (I Have Enough), a work of harrowing beauty, poised on the shadow-line between life and death, may better suit the modern temperament, which tends to concern itself with inevitable extinction\u2014or the possibility of life everlasting\u2014only when the end comes uncomfortably near. The cantata is written for solo voice and accompaniment, and the music explores the weariness of a creature who has known all he needs to of life and is now prepared for release and for union with the God Who, he hopes, awaits him. Ich habe genug cuts two ways: the singer has had enough of the pains of earthly existence, and he has all he will ever need because the Lord is in his heart. Yet the prospect of the divine embrace does not inspire ecstasies; it may not even inspire confidence; there are no rhapsodic leaps heavenward in the music. Nor is there fear or anxiety\u2014just the fatigue of someone who has reached the limits of endurance, and who repeats and repeats all he really knows as his death approaches. This obsessive thought and feeling, spiraling round and round yet never quite reaching a conclusion, complicates the official Christian view of death: although the soul feels God within, death remains a mystery, and might mean simply the end of everything for the human animal, including this strange being\u2019s hopes for eternity. Not a simple and straightforward faith.\nFor those who want an expression of faith unadulterated by doubt, there are Bach\u2019s organ works, notably rendered by Albert Schweitzer, who made several recordings during the 1930s, in London and Strasbourg and Gunsbach churches, of assorted pieces, including chorale preludes and the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, which became the performer\u2019s signature work.

However, the required data rate of 1080p50 and 1080p60 when using MPEG-2 exceeds the maximum provided by the transmission methods used (DVB and ATSC), and most TV production systems are not yet designed for double the data rate.\nThe traditional frequency of 50 or 25 Hz is considered by some experts to be too low for the display of the much larger picture displayed, but this is not used in modern flat screens with at least twice the picture display frequency (100 Hz). The PAL- and SECAM-compatible 50 Hertz have the obvious disadvantage of a more noticeable flicker compared to the NTSC-compatible 60 Hertz on tube screens, but the advantage of a lower data rate with the same compression or vice versa. Cinema films in 24p are usually accelerated by four percent for conversion to PAL format (50 Hz); When converting to NTSC format (60 Hz), jerky movements can occur due to the commonly used telecine method ( 3: 2 pull-up ).\nHDTV video bandwidth\nFull frames (p)\nFields (i)\nPixel rate (descending)\n1080p60 1920 \u00d7 1080 \u00d7 60 Hz\n= 124.4"

The impact of the intervention on the disease can be assessed through government health records in conjunction with the monitoring of other disease control efforts and was not costed as part of the LSM programme.\nFollowing development of the spreadsheet model for each intervention setting, cost implications of two scenarios using the alternative formulations of VectoBac\u00ae were evaluated for Vihiga District (weekly application for four months) and Mbita Division (weekly application all year round).\nScenario 1 - use of WG formulation for liquid application;\nScenario 2 - use of CG formulation for hand application.\nThe type of formulation used affects product storage, associated equipment and shipping costs. The implications of changes in the larvicide product price in both of these scenarios were also examined. In Dar es Salaam larvicide product use was based on actual usage of a combination of WG and CG products, therefore a scenario analysis was not carried out however we did look at the implications of changes in larvicide product prices.\nModel programme structure, staffing and training\nThe proposed programme structure for a LSM programme covering 15 city wards (5 per municipality) is shown in Figure 1. Table 2 lists the staff required and their responsibility in the programme. The programme is overseen by a programme manager who is directly responsible to the City Medical Officer and the NMCP. The manager is assisted in the daily work by two surveillance officers. Each of the three municipalities in Dar es Salaam has a malaria control coordinator that will ensure quality work implemented on ward level. Two inspectors per municipality will implement quality control and help with training activities. Each ward will have a supervisor overseeing the work of community-based resource persons (CORPs) involved in larval surveillance and larviciding. Two larval surveillance CORPs per ward will be responsible for habitat spot checks to ensure that larval habitats are treated in a timely manner and the larvicide is working.

Because Sessions has recused himself from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe, Rosenstein oversees it, which has made him a target of the president's ire.\nTrump's interest in firing Rosenstein has been rumored for months. Sessions reportedly made his show of support for Rosenstein in a phone call with White House Counsel Don McGahn last weekend.\nOne of the Post's sources said the message was not a threat but a communication of \"the untenable position that Rosenstein's firing would\" create for Sessions in an already tumultuous administration.

For most, this is a recycling nightmare at best. For Industrial Design students at AUT, these bottles were a valuable resource to be reimagined in a circular economy challenge.\nLecturer Anke Nienhuis says the milk bottles are a valuable resource that is currently being shipped off-campus. With a group of third-year Industrial Design students, she looked for ways this resource could be reimagined into new products to be used on campus. The results were a selection of high-quality items made from the milk bottle plastic, all applicable in various areas of campus life.\nNienhuis says AUT\u2019s City Campus uses as many as 60,000 milk bottles every year, in normal, non-lockdown times. \"AUT uses milk delivered in triple-layer light-proof plastic bottles \u2013 that's a layer of black plastic sandwiched in between two layers of white plastic. The volume of bottles used on campus provided us with a valuable resource. The students were challenged to develop a way for these bottles to be recycled at AUT, and reimagined into functional products to be used at the university. This allows us to create a small scale circular economy, rather than to send our recyclables away to be processed and hopefully turned into a new product.\n\"We collaborated with the Estates team and staff from AUT's cafes to get empty and cleaned bottles delivered to our studio.

"mind-set,\u201d in the words of one management theorist. The loosening of the nine-to-five workday and the granting of more \u201cflexibility\u201d has resulted in workers feeling the need to give themselves wholly to their companies.\nOne\u2019s leisure time feels like work that one doesn\u2019t have time for.\nSo the speedup is real. But why do we have it? \u201cCapitalism\u201d is the obvious and grating answer, and there\u2019s no question that the need to increase not only productivity, but also circulation and distribution (what Marx saw as the need to cut down on \u201cturnover time\u201d), have driven ever faster cycles of accumulation. But acceleration at the heart of production doesn\u2019t immediately explain acceleration in society, or the feeling that life itself has accelerated. The need to consume more, and consume better and faster\u200a\u2014\u200ato be first in line for the bendy iPhone 6\u200a\u2014\u200adoesn\u2019t give a human being a competitive advantage the way producing a phone without human beings, and delivering that phone all over the planet, does. And of course most of the cultural presuppositions that girded speedup, such as the \u201cProtestant work ethic\u201d and secularization, which led to emphasis on accumulating \u201cthis-worldly\u201d achievements (rather than waiting for the \u201csacral time\u201d after death), preceded the actual acceleration in production.\nNor does it follow that we should have less time as a result of the speedup of production. In fact, the problem may be that we have finally ended up with more free time\u200a\u2014\u200aand yet don\u2019t feel that we have more time. The centrality of this feeling to our age, and to the ages that preceded it, has received its most comprehensive treatment in the recent work of German theorist Hartmut Rosa and his concept of an \u201cacceleration society.\u201d For Rosa, the sense of speedup created by labor-saving is one of the major paradoxes of modernity, and one of the exemplary versions of this paradox is that \u201cthe dramatic rise in feelings of stress and lack of time\u201d in our epoch has been \u201caccompanied by an equally significant increase in free time.\u201d For nearly every population group, even working women, the amount of time free from remunerated labor"

One caveat is if you choose to move to a retirement community, making connections will be much easier.\nWhat Will Your Role Be in the Family?\nConsider how your move will affect the overall family dynamic.\nWill you become the babysitter? Spending time with grandchildren should be a delight rather than a responsibility. While some families depend on grandparents to care for their children due to financial constraints and lack of quality childcare, grandparents must be comfortable with the amount of time they devote to caring for their grandkids and not grow to resent their children's dependency on them.\nHow does your child's spouse feel? While your grown child may be thrilled to have you nearby and able to stop in for visits frequently, his or her spouse may not be quite so excited.

Although there is extensive usage of essential oils and some of their effects have been described, there is a lack of studies on the cytotoxic effects of essential oils and their mechanisms of action.\nDetermining the IC50 value is regarded as a standard when assessing the toxicity of chemical compounds. In this study, the IC50 value for each essential oil was calculated by using a CCK-8 assay. At concentrations close to the oil's IC50 value, cell viability (as %) was shown to be markedly decreased in both human lung cells (A549) and human skin cells (Detroit 551). Cytostatic effects, identified by determining IC50 values, of essential oils from Pinus densiflora for. multicaulis Uyeki, Trifolium repens, Ligularia fischeri, Abies nephrolepis, Illicium anisatum, Zanthoxylum coreanum, Abies koreana, Lindera obtusiloba, Chamaecyparis obtuse, Pinus densiflora, Magnolia kobus, Picea koraiensis, Picea abies, Abies holophylla, and Platycladus orientalis were identified in A549 human lung cells and Detroit 551 human skin cells. Furthermore, at the determined cytotoxicity levels, we examined the expression levels of marker genes and proteins (caspase-3, cyclin A, cyclin B, cyclin D, cyclin E) to elucidate each oil's cytotoxic mechanism. Various mechanisms may be account for the reported cytotoxic effects of some essential oils or their constituents, including induction of cell death by apoptosis and/or necrosis, cell-cycle arrest, and loss of function of key organelles (4).

"countries like Brazil, Colombia, Peru or Indonesia is estimated at over $1 billion per year. More developed markets like Canada or Germany add a much smaller, but less price sensitive market niche. The markets are primarily addressed via local partners with the ability to sell large volumes towards government agencies or utilities serving electrification projects. As assembling can be done locally non-product related costs like transportation or taxes can be reduced and the product can be introduced as \u201cGerman technology produced at home\u201d. This supports acceptance. First partnerships in Indonesia, Peru and Brazil are settled, others are in negotiation. These partnerships are no licensing agreements; SHP manages product development, production and the global brand. The combination of a global sales approach in all major markets and a product which comes plug & play at a competitive price gives Smart Hydro Power a USP in a market which only starts to be fully developed.\nSmart Green Product\nSHP\u2019s micro hydropower system is working with the run of the river (or kinetic) power only. There is no need for any infrastructure besides one anchor point. Therefore electricity generated with the Smart Hydro Power system is not only CO2 free but as well environment- and fish-friendly as it does not have any impact on the natural habitat. While hydropower is nothing new our proprietary system is innovative in at least three aspects: (1) The 5 kW permanent magnet, synchronous, three phase AC generator is the only water resistant unit in its class and allows higher efficiencies than comparable systems, (2) the floating body integrates a diffusor optimizing water pressure upon the rotor and thereby producing maximum power output, (3) the Smart Hydro Power Energy Management System combines a rectifier, battery charger and converter in one system and allows not only the choice between different output possibilities (primary and secondary) but as well the choice between 110 V or 220 V and 50 Hz or 60 Hz. The system can be applied globally and is designed to be maintenance free.

"you can enter the European Championship tournament. There's no need to qualify; you go straight to the finals with two groups of four teams - which you can choose yourself. Each group plays 'round robin' and the top two teams from each go forward to the semi-finals.\nBefore a match you get to pick your formation and team (from a squad of real England stars) - and your opponent's! Not that it makes much difference in the match. The various players don't seem to play any differently and you don't know who you're controlling anyway as the player's name isn't shown.\nBasic player controls include the usual ball-glued-to-foot dribbling, although at least when you reverse direction your player realistically turns through 180 degrees instead of 'flipping'. When you kick the ball, strength and height are determined by how long you hold down Fire. If the ball's in the air you can press fire to attempt a header. You can also slide-tackle opponents, although this runs the risk of a foul. Unfortunately, the resulting free-kick is a farce: a wall of your own players lines up in front of you!\nDefending is made more difficult by the way control automatically switches to the nearest player to the ball (including the goalie), with the player you were previously controlling stupidly running away. This means that in two-player games, you can easily beat your opponent's defence by zigzagging left and right to keep changing which player he's controlling! This forms the general pattern of play as without a radar scanner accurate passing is difficult.\nAlthough two-player games can be hectic fun, England's tournament option offers little challenge and there's a disappointing lack of relevance to the team selection. It's as mediocre as the real thing, I'm afraid.\nLearn The Lingo\nHere are the cliches every international manager should know, and what they really mean...\n1. \"I'm as sick as a parrot\" - I've just been chosen as the new England manager 2. \"The lads are all over the moon\" - I've lifted their Saturday night booze ban 3. \"Our striker's been scoring well at his club\" - Our striker"

On 27 July 2018\u2014National Engineers Day\u2014Mr Quek Yang Boon, director of the Sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) Capability Centre at the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), gave audiences a glimpse of some of the Smart Nation projects that are being carried out in the city state.\nA drone carrying an envelope descended from the upper level of the Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre as Mr Quek compelled the audience to \u201cimagine your letters and parcels delivered right to your doorstep by drones.\u201d\n\u201cWe often talk about dreams taking flight, and in this case, it has,\u201d he said, highlighting SingPost Alpha, a drone that has been used to autonomously deliver a letter to Pulau Ubin, an island off the northeast coast of Singapore. Simple and compact as the drone may appear, it comes equipped with a host of technologies to ensure that it arrives at its destination safely, and that its cargo ends up in the hands of the intended recipient.\nA GPS receiver helps the drone find its own location, and an onboard flight computer charts out flight paths. The drone also has a laser range finder to avoid physical obstacles (and birds), while mounted cameras and radios allow it to communicate with control stations and cargo recipients. Should there be severe turbulence or bad weather during flight, the drone will deploy a parachute to make a gentle landing.\nMr Quek noted how inventions such as SingPost Alpha tap on the power of computing, sensors and IoT to reduce reliance on manpower. The regulation surrounding autonomous drone delivery still needs to be worked out, but the technology has been tested and proven to work.\nHow GovTech trains you in the Sensors and IoT team\nHaving described sensors and IoT in flying gadgets, Mr Quek next highlighted how ground-based devices are also getting an upgrade. As if on cue, a motorised wheelchair rolled itself on stage.\n\u201cThis wheelchair has local navigation capabilities which allow"
"members, is the strongest political entity in Indonesia. Sukarno's personal policies and those of the PKI are in harmony with the Communist states of Asia. He will be cautious about giving the PKI more official power, but, if he lives, the IC sees Indonesia becoming a de facto Communist state, although Sukarno may not proclaim it as such. Should he die or become incapacitated, the PKI might be slowed although it would still have an important role. The longer he lives, the stronger the PKI position. Indonesia is now presenting some of the problems, to the US, that an avowed Communist state would cause: confronting Malaysia and subverting the Philippines. This NIE does not suggest any probable successor government will change radically from this position. While Indonesia's limited military capability and its strategic vulnerability would make it only a potential threat to sea and air lanes, it still would strengthen Peking, while undermining Laos, Thailand and South Vietnam, and presenting a more immediate threat to Malaysia and the Philippines, as well as to Singapore. The Australians would be concerned about east New Guinea and their lines of communications. A Communist Indonesia, still with an independent party, would become a point of rivalry in the Sino-Soviet conflict. The longer-term impact would depend on the continuing independence of the PKI, and how focused it is on consolidating its control and fixing the Indonesian economy. During such a time, it might actually be a liability to China and the Soviet Union.[5] [edit]Anti-communist purge The CIA supplied a list of 4,000 to 5,000 suspected communists, who were rounded up and executed or interrogated. The US government also supplied Indonesian generals with important logistical equipment which helped in this effort. Final estimates of the anti-communist killings range from between 250,000 to 500,000 deaths.[6] [edit]Indonesia 1998 DCI George Tenet said declassification of nine operations constitute a secret history of American power as used against foreign governments by three Presidents.

It is in that important constitutional centrepiece where people should be able to find protection of their rights and freedoms.\nBut the myopic bozos who write and enforce laws don\u2019t recognize the Charter as anything other than a defense argument to be used in court.\nThese strong laws are supposed to be supreme law of the land and were designed to take precedence over other laws and distinguish this nation as a civilized democracy set above dictatorship standards.\nAll lower-ranking legislation is supposed to be Charter-and-Constitution-proofed before Parliament passes it and the Senate rubber-stamps it into law.\nWhat is supposed to be and what is reality are two different things.\nNext in the pecking order of importance under the Constitution is the blizzard of federal laws\u2013some good, some not so good and some just plain awful.

The question the federal Economic Research Service has tried to answer is why. Have federal crop payments sped the concentration of land and the explosion of mega-farms?</p> <p>This isn't just an academic question for rural communities. Andrew Isserman at the University of Illinois has found that the <a href=\"/finding-rural-americas-prosperous-communities\" target=\"_blank\">most prosperous rural communities</a> have high numbers of farms and larger farm employment.

"of the room. Her mouth was covered in tape, skirt hiked up so high he could see the crotch of her black laced teddy under her outerwear. The girl didn't seem to get outside much by how pale her inner thighs were. She definitely didn't hang out with the Sun-Tan Man. The target stared at him through a pair of glasses.\n\"Target confirmed Ry.\" An unecessary comment with Ry in on his feed, but it felt fulfilling nonetheless.\nIt was a trend for some to wear glasses for show, something set in the 22nd Century by some obnoxious sport athletes. While some people still let their eyesight go with no augs and needed real prescriptions, the target seemed to be in great health. There was a window three paces behind her chair, boarded up with planks of wood. \"Now that is old school.\" They must have moved the target quickly, no time to weld the room shut quite yet. His augmentations could take the strain of a two story drop no problem, breaking through the planks would rough him up a bit, but it was nothing that a little RSI maintenance couldn't fix.\nThe rest of the room was a large mass darker than black.

A bit of fur stuck out under one of the covers. The only uncovered piece was a small wooden table with a suitcase on it.

"engines like Apache Drill allow for a single query to merge data from various sources while performing optimizations that work best for each data store. Other popular distributed query engines include projects like Presto/Trino, on top of which companies like Ahana and Starburst offer managed cloud products, and Apache Pig. These distributed engines allow for querying of data directly on your data lake, which is the promise of the Lakehouse concept that continues to garner interest from the data community.\nTo optimize for processing and query times based on the type of data, data scientists often opt for specific types of databases that fit their use case. For example, for processing real-time data with a time component, many organizations are now choosing OLAP databases like Apache Druid. Druid enables fast querying of time-series data, as well as non-time-series data, that is either real-time or historical. Our portfolio company Imply Data offers an enterprise cloud version of Druid, in order to reduce some of the work required for management and deployment of an open-source database. Imply offers an end-to-end suite of tools from a compliance manager to connectors to visualization tools, to enable enterprises to utilize Druid for both business intelligence and operational intelligence use cases.\nWith data preparation work completed and the right processing/querying infrastructure in place, data scientists can now begin to conduct analyses, build models and share their datasets. This piece of the workflow happens in integrated development environments (IDEs) and workspaces (often notebooks).\nIDEs, which combine different automated application development tools into one interface, can serve as a fast way to test and debug code. For data science-specific IDEs like Anaconda\u2019s Spyder or PyCharm, features often include code completion or specific debugging tools for Python models.\nHowever, IDEs can be hard for users without a coding background to interpret because they are designed for users who can read and write code. Additionally, IDEs are not designed for team collaboration and lack features that allow multiple users to easily contribute to code. Therefore, IDEs are often substituted out in favor of notebooks. Notebooks are tools that allow data scientists to combine text that explains their thoughts and work, with code and graphs. Often a supplement to using an IDE for building models, notebooks help with more granular exploration"

The costs of forward development of the system, up to formal acceptance, were GBP 216.9 million, according to NATS's annual report, compared with a budget of GBP 475 million.

To the surprise of many industry watchers, all the major exhibitor chains \u2013 including those that had steadfastly refused to play any of Netflix\u2019s major titles \u2013 agreed to the limited engagement, obviously smelling money.\nTickets for that engagement went on sale accompanied by a TV spot.\nLater in October it was named the opening selection of the Miami Film Festival.\nAt BFI the cast and crew were back together for another screening that only added more positive reviews and buzz to the movie\u2019s publicity\nAt the end of the month another poster came out that has the entire cast arranged along the side of the pool we saw in the first one-sheet.\nThe full official trailer (12.2m YouTube views) was released at the beginning of November.

A week or so later snippets of that score were released for public consumption.\nThe L.A. premiere red carpet was held in mid-November, timed to be just before the movie hit theaters.

"aken to better understand the relationship between systemic JIA and macrophage activation syndrome. Methods. Gene expression profiles were examined in 17 patients with untreated new-onset systemic JIA, 5 of whom showed evidence of subclinical macrophage activation syndrome (of whom 2 eventually developed overt macrophage activation syndrome). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated on Ficoll gradients, and purified RNA was analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip expression arrays. A fraction of the PBMCs were used for flow cytometry to define the cellular composition of the samples. Results. Two hundred twenty-five differentially expressed genes (P < 0.05) that distinguished patients with systemic JIA from healthy controls (n = 30) were identified. Clustering analysis indicated that expression patterns correlated with serum ferritin levels. Three main clusters distinguished systemic JIA patients with highly elevated ferritin levels (including those with subclinical macrophage activation syndrome) from those with normal or only moderately elevated ferritin levels. The first cluster comprised genes involved in the synthesis of hemoglobins and structural proteins of erythrocytes. This transcriptional profile was consistent with immature nucleated red blood cells, likely reflective of high red blood cell turnover. Also included were transcripts indicating immature granulocytes. The second cluster was enriched for genes involved in cell cycle regulation. The third cluster was enriched for genes involved in innate immune responses, including those involved in the negative regulation of Toll-like receptor/ interleukin-1 receptor-triggered inflammatory cascades and markers of the alternative pathway of macrophage differentiation. Additional differentially expressed genes of interest were those involved in the cytolytic pathway, including SH2D1A and Rab27a. Conclusion. These data indicate that gene expression profiling can be a useful tool for identifying early macrophage activation syndrome in patients with systemic JIA.\nU2 - 10.1002/art.22981\nDO - 10.1002/art.2"

The back is slightly changed: NOB has now gone from red letters/black outline to a solid black font. Also, and for some strange reason, the shoulder striping truncates midway down the shoulder.

As the mobile phone marketplace evolved, Blackberry could not keep up with the changes, making their easily recognizable keypad layout obsolete.\nIt would be an apparent mistake to avoid the progression in this area altogether though this could be a clever marketing ploy by Apple, known for its exclusive Apple-only marketplace.

Do you have confidence that the president has clearly not committed the crime of bank robbery (murder, arson, etc.)? If so where is that in your report?\nB. Do you have confidence that President Obama or Secretary Clinton or Vice President Biden has clearly not committed a crime?\nWell, who's fault is that? Mueller's the one who went out of his way to say that he couldn't indict a sitting president. Why make that statement at all? Why muddy the water with irrelevant information?\nAs I wrote a few weeks ago, you can see the ebb and flow of the Mueller investigation in the appendices. The collusion investigation was done by the late Summer of 2017, and only picked up again in September of 2018 when they targeted Jerome Corsi and Roger Stone's connections to Wikileaks (they didn't find any connections there, either- they found Stone Twitter lying about having connections when he really didn't). So the question is- what was Mueller etal doing for the year from late Summer 2017 to late Summer 2018?\nIt basically has to be that they were investigating obstruction- Volume II supports this conclusion, but why did it take another 18 months? There really is only one explanation for the time taken- they were hoping to induce real obstruction in the form of Mueller/Rosenstein getting fired, or Trump invoking executive privilege and withholding documents and witnesses. Unfortunately for the Democrats, Trump refused to take any of those additional actions- at best all he did was talk about taking such actions. Trump's legal team was smart enough to prevent Trump from taking such actions, or at least talking him down from it.\nBy September 2018, Mueller's team"
"due to critics or due to a normal fluctuation in the business).\nSecond, the salaries of the officers seem a little high for an organization of that size. Total comp for the 8 named officers of $1.56 million was about 13% of total revenue. For a small company, that's definitely excessive. I would love to see any perspective from former Narconon staffers about what percentage of their income the management of Narconon \"contributes\" back to the cult directly. In other words, I strongly suspect that the excessive comp here is just a way for the cult to extract more money from Narconon without it being directly traceable. I also seem to recall that the earlier Vista Bay 990 that I looked at (2008?) had far lower salaries for top management, when revenue was substantially lower. That furthers the idea that they're adjusting salaries not based on economics and performance but they're using the salary amount to shovel money back to the cult quietly.\n\"Advertising and Promotion\" expenses of $1.95 million probably includes the network of referral sites that get paid 10% commissions. Again, I strongly suspect that these are Scientologists who are \"regged\" of nearly all that amount -- after all, the cult knows how much those guys are getting paid so they won't be shy about asking for \"their\" money back.\n\"Payments to Affiliates\" of $1.16 million is almost certainly the amount of money that flows \"uplines\" to Narconon International, to ABLE and then directly into Scientology coffers. That's almost exactly 10% of program revenue, which I think is the \"licensing fee\" for the \"tech\" that we've seen elsewhere. This is probably about the most they could get away with disclosing as direct payments without triggering alarm bells from someone merely casually reading these financial statements. Since they're limited in direct payments to the cult, they have to find other ways to suck money out of the machine.\nThe balance sheet on Page 11 of the 990 is also interesting. Narconon only keeps cash on hand of about $990,000 at the end of the year, which is"

"the picture. We have devoted our careers to fighting the large insurance companies who seek to prey on the victims of trucking accidents in Raleigh and throughout North Carolina. We fight to hold negligent drivers and trucking companies accountable for the damage they leave behind, vigorously pursuing financial compensation for medical expenses, pain, and suffering lost earnings and more.\nOur Skilled Raleigh Personal Injury Attorneys Provide Customized Legal Solutions For All North Carolina Residents In The Following Practice Areas:\nDog Bites & Attacks\nTruck Accidents Resources:\nThe Importance Of NHTSA Requirements\nThe NHTSA keeps a safety record for every trucking company in the United States so they are able to take action against those who violate federal transportation safety regulations. The connection between violations and accidents is clear. When trucking companies and their drivers fail to follow the rules that govern rest requirements, truck maintenance, and hiring practices, innocent people pay the price in the form of catastrophic injuries and deaths on our nation\u2019s highways.\nIt is clear how important it is for truckers and trucking companies to abide by NHTSA regulations. It\u2019s just as important for the NHTSA to implement new, innovative regulations to keep up with the pace of available safety technology. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has recommended mandatory crash avoidance systems for large trucks for decades now, but the NHTSA has been slow to act. Such systems could compensate for human error and truck driver impairment, including drowsy truckers who are driving in violation of rest requirements. At Roberts & Harris, we\u2019re for anything that can reduce crashes in North Carolina and keep people safe.\nIt\u2019s Your Pain. You Deserve More\nPersonal injury compensation is about making sure you have the resources you need to recover physically, emotionally, and psychologically after an accident. You\u2019ve suffered enough at the hands of negligent drivers and trucking companies. You can count on us to make sure you are not injured a second time by the insurance companies.

"have that isolated hypothetical passage turned into a theory of the Rebbe as the Lonely Man of Faith.\nThe Rebbe\u2019s loneliness was perhaps inevitable. Those who had once been his peers, workmates and colleagues became his subordinates and Chasidim. Although their relationships continued, these were no longer ordinary friendships. Having assumed the responsibility of solving his Chasidim\u2019s personal problems, he could no longer talk to them as an equal. This created an existential choice for loneliness, which might even be termed \u201caloneness.\u201d From his deep relationship with his family, we know he had the capacity of intimacy with others. Yet, in the official role that consumed his life, it could not be expressed.\nWhat about the stories of supernatural precognition? Steinsaltz does not give us lots of colorful stories of people coming to the Rebbe and him saving them against all odds. Rather, we get a universal call to the possibility of Enlightenment and prophecy within all of us.\nThose with the gift of ruach hakodesh describe it as a kind of sight-seeing, perceiving or experiencing things that are physically or tempo\u00acrarily at a distance. In the nineteenth century, the second and the third rebbes of the Komarno dynasty described their experiences of ruach hakodesh in the book, The Scroll of Secrets. Both state that they had this ability since a very young age. Given only someone\u2019s name, the Kom\u00acarno rebbes could provide a full physical description of a person whom they had never met.\nA college student once had the temerity to ask the Rebbe if he had supernatural powers. The Rebbe answered that these powers are within the grasp of every Jew. The ability to control nature and to rise above it comes from a devout and complete adherence to God\u2019s will, from the observance of mitzvot and the study of Torah. Each of us can rise above our situation. The question before us, the Rebbe continued, is whether we have the determination and the commitment to reach our potential.\nFinally, what about the messianism? Steinsaltz portrays the Rebbe as concerned with the topic since his youth, that he did not see himself as the"

"bay, flare bay and an additional fuel tank. The crew was limited to two, pilot and navigator unlike the B.2 which had 3 crew (pilot, navigator observer and navigator plotter). Otherwise the PR.3 was very similar in performance, save for longer range, to the B.2\nAs the B.6 evolved from the B.2, with more powerful engines (the Avon Mk 109 RA 7) and more fuel capacity \u2013 so did the PR.7 evolve from the PR.3. The Canberra PR.7 was to the PR.3 as the B.6 was to the B.2. The PR.7 had the integral wing tanks, engine anti-icing and \u201cMaxaret\u201d anti-skid brakes that were introduced in the B.6 version. The more powerful engines gave it a higher service ceiling than the first generation Canberras and the ability to carry more fuel and/or payload. The PR.7 had an additional ventral fuel tank of 417 gallons capacity in the fuselage that gave it more range than the bomber versions.\nThe only unit to operate PR Canberras in the Indian Air Force was the newly raised 106 Flight which was raised with 5 Canberra PR.57s in May 1957. After the amalgamation of 102 Survey flight which had 3 Dakotas, 106 Flight became 106 Squadron in 1959. 106 at various times has had the appellation \u201cStrategic Photo Reconnaissance\u201d (SPR) or \u201cStrategic Reconnaissance Squadron\u201d (SRS) applied to it.\nThe PR.57s differed from the RAF\u2019s PR.7s in equipment fit \u2013 they had autopilot, radio altimeters and improved navigation kit \u2013which were not standard on the PR.7.

"casualty rate from flying accidents was often as high as in the operational squadrons. As a result, a lot of experienced aircrew who had survived the rigors of that first tour were killed or injureded during their time in the OTU\u2019s / OCU\u2019s \u2014 which completely belied the rest break they were supposed to be getting.\nSince the law of diminishing returns was painfully most relevant to any aircrew\u2019s chances of survival as the number of missions flown accumulated, those who elected to take the latter course and fly a straight 45 missions were hardly better off.\nIt has been calculated that the average casualty rate among Bomber Command aircrew throughout the war was about 4%. Obviously, there were missions where this rate was drastically higher ( as in the disastrous Nuremberg raid of November 30th/31st, 1944 ), and others where the rate was much lower. What the seemingly innocuous statistic of \u201conly\u201d 4% really meant was that, in theory, the entire original complement of aircrew in any squadron would be wiped out well before the initial 30-mission mark was reached. In practice, some crews were shot down on their first few missions while others were lost halfway through their tours, and so a small fortunate handful would survive to complete that first tour. The odds against survival then increased almost exponentially with additional missions or tours completed. That is what the hard, cold, inexorable arithmetic of a 4% caualty rate truly represented. Such was the cost, and such was the sacrifice.\nIn that light, your acquaintance was incredibly lucky to have survived three tours. It also means that he probably volunteered for the third tour when he clearly didn\u2019t have to, which says a great deal for his courage and fortitude, particularly since tail gunner casualty rates were higher than for other crew positions.\nFurther to the military and military procurement being far from Laissez-faire.

And if you were to have, say like an inner city population that has lived in Chicago or Detroit or something and you\u2019ve had three, four, five, six generations that have lived in an environment in which they don\u2019t have enough vitamin D, they\u2019ve eaten more processed food and consequently, everybody has been sicker, multiple rounds of antibiotics, maybe getting tonsils removed it, et cetera, et cetera.

And this is something that I think needs to be well appreciated within public health and also personalized medicine is that asking where did your grandparents grow up? Were they on the farm? Did they live in the city? Did they have an auto immune condition? Did they use a lot of antibiotics? Did you as a kid use a lot of antibiotics? And if you go to someone like a naturopath or a functional medicine doctor, they will oftentimes ask these questions. Within conventional medical settings, these questions aren\u2019t really considered. And so they\u2019re not factored into the whole picture. And I know I\u2019m kind of bouncing around here, but it\u2019s a really good question, Tim has a great question.\nRobb: I think that as time goes on, we won\u2019t be able to ignore the impact of these kinds of multi-generational effects. At some point, we\u2019ve got to start asking some questions, what are the things that we need to do to mitigate these impacts? It would be nice to have antibiotics as a backstop against dangerous infectious disease, but we need to get much better at doling these things out at the appropriate time. And something like 75 or 80% of antibiotics are used in animal husbandry, and that is leading to antibiotic resistance. That could change things a lot.

"-being against a backdrop of Israeli hegemony.\nAt a local level, widespread dissent is expressed towards Israel as an occupying power. Jordan encourages a relatively free media climate, and the government tolerates widespread anti-Israeli discourse in the media \u2014 possibly as a counterbalance to general public knowledge of the government\u2019s extensive cooperation with Israel and possibly so as to not deny what Jordanian civilians already know too well, having experienced firsthand the repercussions of Israel\u2019s brutal occupation. The average Jordanian renders Israel as a settler-colonial state and thus, the enemy.\nIn short, peace is not trusted. The majority of civilians believe that Israel wants to monopolize power over the Arab states \u2014 all while continuing its occupation of Palestine, retaining its territorial buffers and exercising military superiority in the region. And, in recent times, it is proving more and more difficult for the Jordanian government, in its commitment to peace, to disprove Israel\u2019s insidious actions.\n2020: A Volatile Peace\nDespite the recent presidential election victory for the Biden-Harris administration, the future of Israel-Jordan peace and the relative peace in the region remains unclear. The Democrat party has experienced fractures in its pro-Israel consensus, with left-leaning progressives calling for an end to the United States\u2019 unbreakable support for Israel. Nonetheless, on matters pertaining to Israel, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris emphasizes a hawkish, unwaveringly pro-Israel stance, undermining expectations for a reversal of the \u201cPeace to Prosperity\u201d plan proposed earlier this year.\nTrump\u2019s \u201cPeace to Prosperity\u201d plan, proposed in January 2020, advances an annexation of Palestinian lands in an attempt to expand the state of Israel. This follows the relocation of the US embassy to Jerusalem, changing the US\u2019s historic stance on Jerusalem as an international territory. Such recognition of Jerusalem directly undermines the terms of the 1994 treaty, which gave special recognition to the role of Jordan in Muslim Holy shrines in Jerusalem.

"es on with Giants\nRoss (foot) has signed a one-year, $2.5 million deal with the Giants, Jordan Raanan of ESPN.com reports.\nAnalysis: Per the report, $1 million of the wideout's deal is guaranteed. Assuming he's past the foot issue that derailed his 2020 campaign, the 2017 first-rounder will add some much-needed speed to the Giants' pass-catching corps. Ross has much to prove after faltering during his four-year tenure with the Bengals, but when healthy, the 25-year-old has the wheels to serve as a big play threat. With a fresh start in New York, a 2021 bounce-back is plausible.\nPublished: Tue, Mar 16 at 12:51pm by Rotowire.com\nLands on IR\nThe Bengals have placed Ross (foot) on injured reserve, Marisa Contipelli of the Bengals' official site reports.\nAnalysis: Ross has not played since Week 6 due to a variety of issues. He will now be sidelined at least the next three games. It has been rumored that the 24-year-old and 2017 first-round pick could be transitioned into cornerback due to the team's lack of depth at the position. However, for now he will simply focus on his foot recovery.\nPublished: Sat, Nov 14 at 11:13am by Rotowire.com\nNot moving to corner\nRoss (foot) never actually practiced at cornerback and only discussed moving to the position with the Bengals' coaching staff, Mike Garafolo of NFL Network reports.\nAnalysis: This follows an initially incorrect report by Garafolo that Ross had actually injured his foot while practicing at cornerback. The Bengals' dire need to provide depth at cornerback at least allowed them to broach the conversation with the 24-year-old, but no positional move appears to be imminent, especially after Ross suffered a foot injury, which will keep him out for Week 10 and potentially future weeks.\nInjured transitioning to corner\nRoss, who will not play in Week 10 after injuring"

In addition to the sprouting variability, \u201cNo two humans are alike, and people have different sensitivities and [digestive] systems,\u201d Sorrells says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know until you actually try it.\u201d But also, Carson points out, if you have no trouble digesting regular bread then you may not even notice a difference at all.\nOkay, so what about the nutritional value? Is it higher in sprouted grains? In theory, potentially, yeah. In addition to breaking down some of those big energy reserves inside the seed, the sprouting process may increase the micronutrient content of the grain. For instance, many grains contain a substance called phytic acid that binds to certain minerals (like iron, calcium, and zinc), making them less bioavailable to us because we don\u2019t have the enzymes needed to break phytic acid down, Sorrells explains. Sprouting can actually begin to break down some of that phytic acid for us, making the minerals more available, some studies have found. Sprouting may also increase the levels of some vitamins, like vitamin E and B.\n3 Things to Do When You Wake Up at 3 A.M. and Hate Everything\nBy \u200bJessica Migala\n45 Cute and Fun Gifts to Send Your Long-Distance Partner for Valentine\u2019s Day\nBy Sara Coughlin\n69 Gifts for Boyfriends That Will Arrive in Time for Valentine\u2019s Day\nBy Tiffany Dodson\nBut IRL, it is again tricky to make hard-and-fast determinations about the nutritional advantages sprouting leads to.\nWhich vitamin levels might go up and to what degree really depends not just on the grain but the exact sprouting conditions, James says. This is pretty clear when you look at the studies collected in a recent meta-review. Some show sizable increases, while others found more moderate, or zero changes in vitamin content after sprouting And crucially, as James notes, there is a lack of human studies showing that this increased bioaccessibility actually leads to increased vitamin and"

They only should cover visible feminine attributes like hair or body contours to please their god. And this could also be reached with many different kinds of Western clothing, right? In addition, they are outside of the original Arab area, the house of Islam/ dar-al-Islam as it is called, so they are not even obliged to take all measures or abiding to all religious rules. They could even easily show up with longer hair and eat pork meat if they excuse to their god during prayers, because when in France they are in the so-called dar-al-harb area, house of war, or let\u2019s be gentle and translate it with area of non-Islamic people or unbelievers. Considering that, it\u2019s obvious they want to loudly and visibly extend the Islamic ruled original area in Arabia to all other global areas, so the real problem is in their head, not with whatever cover on it.\nOk, so If I follow your logic, because only SOME Muslim women are for unequality, we should allow headscarves?\nThe number does not matter, the problem is the meaning behind headscarves.\nAnd also, the few studies done in France on this topic confirm that headscarf is a political and religious statement.\nI do not have anti-Muslim bias, I only have an equality bias.\nThat is fine, you can post about all the examples you want, the point is that in France, we only have issues with headscarves, so Muslims. Other religions/faiths do not request changes to public spaces and do not promote unequality through their positions.\nBigYen, your argument is skewed as headscarves impacts on everybody and these women have been indoctrinated since they are born, so yes obviously they want to wear it, it does not make it right.\nI suggest you all look into the #LetUsTalk campaign so you can see what Muslim women think about headscarves and"
"an alignment between inflation and interest yield curve and negative returns.\u201d\nThe Dairy Hills chief, who is a strong player in the agricultural sector, said food prices would continue to surge as inflationary pressures take their effect on rising input cost.\nAccording to Emmanuel, \u201cFor some of us in agriculture and farming generally, it is not easy because of the prices of diesel and fertiliser. Diesel price 12 months ago was N280 per litre, but today, you will get it at N700 per litre. It\u2019s the same thing with the price of fertiliser. A bag of fertiliser a year ago was N14,000 per bag, now it\u2019s N17,000.\u201d\nHe expected the surge in fertiliser price to continue because phosphate and potash constitute 40 to 50 per cent of the blending of the fertiliser imported from Russia.\n\u201cOwing to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, you could see the effect, as the Nigerian government has shifted focus now to Canada for such imports.\n\u201cThis is the reason you see the price of poultry feeds inputs going up because Russia contributes 44 per cent of global potash supply,\u201d he stressed.\nWith the Nigerian economy remaining a consumption one and less productive, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has been making efforts to control inflation to a manageable level. To stem imports and conserve dollars, the CBN put some 42 items hitherto being imported on the banned list.\nFurthermore, in controlling inflation, the CBN, in 2021, debited 10 banks a whopping N7.02 trillion over their failure to meet the 27.5 per cent Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) threshold.\nThe CRR is the minimum amount banks and merchant banks are expected to retain with the CBN from customer deposits, carries no interest and is not available for use by the banks in their day-to-day operations.\nAnalysts, agreeing it is part of the process of solving the structural problems of inflation, stressed the strategy is not enough unless a productive and better management of the economy is encouraged.\nN"
"later that evening and Mendicino said he does not believe the information in Lucki\u2019s email ever came up. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared a federal emergency the next day.\nThe commission is investigating the events that led to that decision and is tasked with determining whether the government was justified in invoking the Emergencies Act for the first time since it replaced the War Measures Act in 1988.\nA formal inquiry is mandatory any time the legislation is used to grant extraordinary powers to police, governments and banks, as it was during the protests in Ottawa and border crossings.\nThe RCMP were able to arrest several protesters in Coutts and end the blockade without using the additional powers afforded to them under the Emergencies Act.\nEven before hundreds of big rigs and thousands of protesters descended on the parliamentary precinct, Mendicino said he believed the protest had the potential to be violent, although the RCMP told him \u201cthe majority of information\u201d showed organizers were planning a peaceful event.\nHe said he felt that videos like the one posted by controversial \u201cFreedom Convoy\u201d figure Pat King, which referred to the protest ending in bullets, were a \u201csignal of intent.\u201d\n\u201cThere were many thousands of Canadians who participated in these demonstrations and in the blockade who were there for entirely legitimate and lawful purposes, but some were prepared to become violent,\u201d Mendicino said.\nSeveral federal cabinet ministers, including Dominic LeBlanc, were worried about their personal safety from the outset of the protest in Ottawa because some demonstrators had posted online about targeting their homes, the inquiry heard.\nNotes from a Jan. 26 ministerial briefing show RCMP were aware of protesters trying to gather the home addresses of members of Parliament, including Trudeau, and were concerned the protest could break apart to include several locations close to politicians\u2019 homes.\nLeBlanc, the minister of intergovernmental affairs, also testified late Tuesday afternoon.\nThe RCMP boosted security around several cabinet ministers and Canada\u2019s chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, because the protests were focused on COVID-19 public health restrictions, Mendicino said.\nAs the protest unfolded in Ottawa, at provincial"

In some cases, the most important question is whether a competitor will respond to decisions you make.\nFor example, will a competitor react if you enter a customer segment that the competitor presently serves? Or, will a competitor react if you decide to change your strategy by emphasizing or de-emphasizing certain key customer benefits, or decide to increase your advertising expenditures? In other cases, you may have some assumptions about actions (even unprovoked actions) your competitor might make in the future.\nThese questions should be directly applied to each segment that was analyzed during customer analysis (see the How to Segment a Market tutorial). There we found that perhaps to compete successfully in a segment, certain benefits would need to be addressed and communicated. Now ask yourself the question: What will the competitor do in response? The same can be done when considering entry into a new segment. Again, ask yourself: What will the competitor do in response?\nThese types of questions can be framed in terms of a game, since the actions of the two actors (i.e., you and your competitor) are typically interdependent. Thinking of business strategy in game-like terms has lately become more popular and rigorous. One recent article that deals with this subject is by Brandenburger, Adam and Barry J.

"for deep learning. A guided tour of the Museum\u2019s signature Revolution exhibit grounded students in history by exploring key people, innovations, and technology companies that have changed the world. From the humble roots of IBM in a census tabulating machine to the hubris of executives who dismissed the personal computer as a toy, students learned that business is all about making choices. And innovation is driven by people trying to solve problems, just as they are attempting to do with their own startup ideas.\nA scavenger hunt through the exhibit allowed teams of students to explore what it is about the Silicon Valley ecosystem that helps entrepreneurs to thrive, including a culture that values information sharing and encourages employees to spinoff new companies, a skilled talent pool, and established companies, universities, research centers and professional services committed to entrepreneurship. Innovations fostered in the open atmosphere of Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) and the Homebrew Computer Club contributed features and functions to personal computers and later handheld devices like Palm and the iPhone.

In December, Singer announced her sabbatical.\nShe has yet to comment publicly on this story, but previously acknowledged some mistakes in internal communications sent to MPG representatives, writing that \u2018Problems associated to my exhaustion due to having to carry and be responsible for [a] huge and complex study\u2019 were partly to blame for her behavior.

I have called the police and told them about Patrick and Kelvin.\n@jaxtanui And where to find the car.\nThe young man placed the phone on the barstool and walked to the restroom.

The man walked out into the night.\nKip tried to flip the book forward but it would not let him. It violently glowed a fierce glow and shut itself tight.

One of those City Hoppas he used to ride before he bought a car. He coughed and the movement woke up all the pain receptors in his body. His chest was bandaged up but he could feel like each breath threatened to open up whatever stitches he may have. He also had a monstrous headache.\nAnd he was thirsty.\nSoon, a nurse came by with a glass of water and a bendy straw. The kind you get with Ribena juice boxes. She also brought with her Kip\u2019s wallet which had been in his back pocket when he arrived. A police officer accompanied her.

"surcharge would build up the CPA fund quickly, there were not enough projects queued up to justify it, he said. Another consideration focused on the impact on taxpayers. \u201cWe wanted to keep it (annual add-on) under $50 \u2026\u201d he said.\nBased on a formula noted in his presentation, Przybyla said the surcharge would add about $39 to the annual tax bill for an \u201caverage\u201d single family home in town, minus an exemption that reduces that base valuation by $1,000, for calculation purposes.\nThere are other exemptions that could cut or even cancel the surcharge pay-in, as well, for low income residents and low to moderate income seniors, for example. Most likely, most people over 60 won\u2019t pay a surcharge, he posited, based on state-set thresholds. They must apply for the exemption, however.\nPrzybyla explained that the CPA fund \u2014 the amount collected by the town from the surcharge \u2014 plus money kicked in by the state that comes from deed registration fees (32% now) can only be used for three purposes: Open space and outdoor recreation, affordable housing and historic preservation.\nThe law states how much of the total nest egg must be used for projects in those categories, he said, 10% each. The remaining 70% can be saved, building up the balance each year. That money can be used to buy land for open space or recreation, for example. It can also be applied toward local matching amounts required for some government grants. Or for affordable community housing, which in turn could help the town meet its quota under state law.\nUnder the provisions of that law, known as Chapter 40B, the state requires that each community in the Commonwealth meet a specific benchmark: 10% of existing units.\nCommunities that fall short, including Shirley, are open to so-called \u201chostile 40B\u201d development, which allows developers who set aside 25% of the units they build to site their projects almost anywhere in town, regardless of zoning and to bypass other zoning bylaw requirements, such as density.\n\u201cWhat is the danger of not adopting CPA?\u201d a resident asked, phrasing the question in that light.\nPrzyby"

This becomes easier to understand, when it is realized that the event took place when Roman ships ruled the ocean waves.\nIt was said of Hannibal, \"one of the most illustrious figures in the history of humanity,\" that the great Carthaginian general had disciplined his body to hardship, his appetite to moderation, his tongue to silence and his thought to objectivity. He ate the same food, wore the same clothes, slept on the same ground and suffered the same hardships as his men. His personal bravery as the first man in and the last man out of any battle was equalled only by his brilliance as the greatest general of his time. This commanding presence with piercing eyes and penetrating genius, set out with 59,000 troops and 40 elephants on an intrepid trek across the Alps to face and fight the Romans in an epic battle in northern Italy. To inspire terror Hannibal situated the elephants in the front line. The trumpets and horns of the Roman army caused such a clamour that elephants on the left flank turned back against their own lines. However, some of the daunting, daring behemoths lumbered on against the enemy with devastating effect on the ranks of the light infantry.\nHannibal at the Battle of Zana\nWhile he defeated the Roman army in a number of subsequent encounters.

Its CEO Bill Newlands believes the stock is a bargain at the current price, and the company would be \u201csilly\u201d not buying back.\nIn case you might be interested, Constellation Brands is America\u2019s largest bear import company by sales. It also ranks third in market share among the major beer suppliers. Investors have always held this stock which has been regarded as very defensive during tough times. Zacks Research assigns a PEG ratio of 1.77, less than the Beverages \u2013 Alcohol industry ratio of 1.94. That means that investors may view the stock as relatively undervalued compared to the industry.\nReflecting on the recent selloff, Newlands says the stock selloff is an \u201cover reaction\u201d to the company\u2019s reported earnings. That was after the company generated an adjusted EPS of $2.83 in its latest quarter, below estimates of $2.89. The EPS was also lower than $3.12 last year. Still, Constellation grew net sales by 5% to $2.44 billion or \u00a32.05 billion. The sales topped $2.38 billion or \u00a32 billion estimates. We believe this stock is attractive, but a key level must hold to buy now;"

Lin Feiran was very resentful; he and Gu Kaifeng became archnemesis (one-sidedly). Although the two lived together, they were like strangers. When Lin Feiran went back home to attend his grandfather\u2019s funeral, he accidentally inherited the Yin Yang eyes that were passed down from generation to generation. After gaining the ability to see ghosts, the timid Lin Feiran discovered that his two-person dormitory was actually a sixteen-persons (ghosts) room. Every day he was scared to the point of collapsing. The more frightening thing is that because of Gu Kaifeng\u2019s innate body constitution, he possessed an abundant amount of Yang energy. Li Feiran found out that whenever he touched Gu Kaifeng, the other person\u2019s Yang energy could temporarily disable his Yin Yang eyes."

What is more: the integrated exhaust flaps can vary the exhaust note. The driver can thus select the discreet, emphatically quiet \u201cComing home\u201d mode. In the open \u201cSport\u201d position, the V8 produces an extra powerful sound.\nThe sporty appearance can be dynamically enhanced with sporty, elegantly styled BRABUS naked-carbon aerodynamic-enhancement components, which can be ordered with either high-gloss or matte coating. Together with the BRABUS air intakes on the left and right in the radiator grille, the front spoiler lip gives the supercar sedan or wagon an even more striking face. At high speeds, the aerodynamic-enhancement component reduces front-axle lift and thus optimizes handling stability.\nThe BRABUS rear spoiler on the trunk lid of the sedan was shaped to generate downforce on the rear axle for an optimal aerodynamic balance. There is also a carbon diffuser insert for the rear fascia of both body styles, which perfectly frames the four tailpipes of the BRABUS sports exhaust and completes the sporty design package.\nThe exclusive BRABUS look naturally also includes custom alloy wheels, which are offered for all E 63 S models in various dimensions up to 21 inches in diameter. The vehicle pictured here features BRABUS Monoblock \u201cPLATINUM EDITION\u201d Z forged wheels, which have not only been painted in vehicle color but have been pinstriped in the same contrasting color to match the red signature stripes in the radiator grille.

"symmetries. There is an approximate Killing field \u03c7a which generates boosts orthogonal to P and vanishing at P. A boosted reference frame with acceleration a, possesses an Unruh temperature T=a\u210f2\u03c0. The heat flow can be determined by the boost-energy current of matter Tab\u03c7a where Tab is the matter energy momentum tensor. Thus we find the heat flow past P to be\n\u03b4Q=\u222bHd\u03a3bTab\u03c7a. (41)\nHere we are integrating over a pencil of generators of the inside past horizon H of P. Now let ka be the tangent vector to the horizon generators for an affine parameter \u03bb that vanishes at P and is negative in the past. This implies \u03c7a=\u2212a\u03bbka and d\u03a3b=kbd\u03bbd2A. Thus we may rewrite our expression for the heat flux as\n\u03b4Q=\u2212a\u222bHd\u03bbd2A\u03bbTabkakb. (42)\nRecalling the result for the temperature we find the entropy change to be\n\u03b4QT=(2\u03c0/\u210f)\u222bd\u03bbd2ATabkakb(\u2212\u03bb). (43)\nThe entropy change is also given by the change in the area of the horizon\n\u03b4S=\u03b1\u03b4A. (44)\nNow recall the Raychaudhuri equation (see also App. C),\nd\u03b8d\u03bb=\u221212\u03b82\u2212\u03c3ab\u03c3ab\u2212Rabkakb. (45)\nAlso recall that the expansion parameter, \u03b8 and the shear, \u03c3 vanish at p. This condition yields\n\u03b8=\u2212\u03bbRabkakb+O(\u03bb2). (46)\nThis implies that to lowest order in \u03bb the entropy change is given by\n\u03b4S=\u03b1\u222bHd\u03bbd2ARabkakb(\u2212\u03bb). (47)\nIf we now require that Clausius relation hold for each local Rindler horizon we find that the integrands of the (43) and (47) are equivalent for all null vectors ka. Equating coefficients of \u03bb yields\nRab+\u03a6gab=(2\u03c0/\u210f\u03b1)Tab, (48)\nwhere \u03a6 is unknown function.

"at was unable to beat Pakistan for a full 7 years at Sharjah, which was the annual high-voltage clash between these two nations. Pakistan had a strong team, and perhaps most importantly, was far better led, than Bharat was during that period.\nOne comment that one heard many times back then, and even now, is that \u201cyou need beef to bowl fast, you need beef to win, beef gives you that \u2018killer instinct.\u2019\u201d Indeed, this elusive \u2018killer instinct\u2019 which we Bharatiyas in general, and Hindus in particular, lacked, was because we did not eat beef. I have to concede that I heard this comment not only from Pakistanis, but even Bharatiyas, of all religions. After all, it was argued, what else could explain that Bharat with its far larger population, was unable to beat Pakistan in cricket?\nSomehow, I never bought this argument. I always thought of warriors like Shivaji \u2013 perhaps possessing the most nous, killer instinct, presence of mind, and raw energy of the moment displayed by anyone in the past 400 years in the subcontinent. I thought of the battle of Pratapgad, where Shivaji killed a full-of-beef Afzal Khan with out of this world \u2018killer instinct\u2019. Shivaji not only did not eat beef, he considered the protection of the cow as one of his highest goals.\nThings have changed. The Bharatiya economy is today a \u2018tiger\u2019: a term once reserved for Japan, Korea, and smaller countries like Singapore. It is indeed the fastest growing major economy in the world for the past couple of years.\nCricket has changed too. Bharat is ranked No. 1 in test cricket, and boasts a 4-pronged pace attack that has taken 20 wickets in each of its past 5 overseas test (with one exception where a declaration happened). Bharatiya pacers are, on average, quicker than their Pakistani counterparts. Bharat can put up at least 6 bowlers who can bowl at the 90mph mark if they exert themselves. Their skill levels are also being talked of at the highest levels.\nBut"

Once they do so and later become the new members of the older generation, only a few will likely go back to getting news information from local TV broadcasts.\nWhat happens next if future viewers belonging to the older generation are all astute social media users?\nLocal TV News Perform Strongly During Election Periods\nCurrently though, local TV news stations are experiencing an upswing in sponsorships and viewership, in light of campaigns related to the forthcoming U.S. presidential elections; starting with the primaries by as early as February 03, 2020 up to the general election on November 03, 2020. In between those dates, there are rallies, debates and conventions that local tv news cover for the benefit of their respective region\u2019s voting public.\nOnce the elections are over, it would bring the status quo to normal, which means sliding back to a stagnating, if not failing condition. Presumably, local TV news stations will wait two years for the midterm elections and for four years for the next round of presidential elections.\nIn the meantime, the waiting period will put them back in the same precarious position of having to struggle against the growing power of social media. Not unless the industry strategizes with what, when and how they deliver news content.\nPlanners and strategists though, must make it a point to work hand in hand with financial experts, preferably those connected with a reputable tax firm.

Every evening, between 300 and 500 asylum seekers gather to protest against proposed Australian government policy that would see them left doubly discriminated against and facing a life sentence on Nauru.\nUnder the proposed temporary protection visa legislation, asylum seekers who arrived on the same boats as those sent to Nauru and Manus Island, will be processed and resettled in Australia.\nThe asylum seekers have been enraged by recent Immigration Department promises to improve the conditions, such as food and water, in the family camp. \u201cThey think they can deceive us,\u201d one asylum seeker told the Refugee Action Coalition, \u201cIt is hypocrisy to say they are improving services while denying our future.\u201d\nHunger strike spreads to single men\u2019s camp\nAround 90 asylum seekers, mostly Burmese, Bangladeshi and Iranian, have been on hunger strike for the last three days (ie since Saturday 4 October).

"ostat 80 mg/d was superior to allopurinol 300 mg/d in reducing SUA levels to lower than 6 mg/dL in mildly to moderately renally impaired study participants.31,32 Mobilization flares were very common, requiring concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis, as with allopurinol. During phase 3 studies, mild transaminase elevations greater than 3 times the normal limit were observed in the febuxostat group.31 The major clinical niche for febuxostat is patients with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease and those intolerant to allopurinol.\nUricosuric drugs. The uricosuric agents (probenecid, sulfinpyrazone, and benzbromarone) represent another class of SUA-lowering medications. They act by inhibiting the urate transporter URAT1 at the tubules, thus raising the renal excretion of urate.\nIn patients with a history of renal calculi, uricosuric drugs need to be used with caution. Alkalinization of urine and high urine volumes are required. Benzbromarone has been removed from US and some European markets because of concerns about severe hepatotoxicity, but it is available in some countries with restricted use.\nUricases. An alternative approach to reducing SUA is the use of uricase, which mediates the conversion of uric acid into the more soluble molecule allantoin, in the rasburicase or pegloticase (PEGylated) form.33-35 In humans, uricase is very effective in preventing and managing tumor lysis syndrome. Both forms of uricase have lowered SUA levels rapidly in clinical trials, but the need for parenteral administration and development of antiuricase antibodies would probably limit their repeated use to select cases of severe gout. Infusion reactions to uricase have caused the overwhelming majority of study withdrawals to date, and the serious nature of some of these reactions may also limit its future use.34 Warranting mention for their"

"something that academics elucidate and reveal to us great untutored masses. They create their own discourses and that is pretty much what\u2019s been going on here. Notsneaky probably had the right idea, although I\u2019m fascinated by train wrecks.\nHi David. While I\u2019ll admit to being intemperate a number of times in my life, I should note that it\u2019s been notsneaky, marc, henri, and other defenders of GGS who showered me with \u201cyou\u2019re naive!\u201ds and \u201cwhy are you calling me a racist!?\u201ds and other button-pushers. Oh, and called me a crackpot, which I actually kind of enjoyed.\nI personally have questioned nobody\u2019s motives nor impugned anyone\u2019s intelligence, although both have been done to me. And although nobody here has called anyone a racist by any stretch, y\u2019all keep saying that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. That\u2019s not me being intemperate, that\u2019s a bunch of Diamond fans being reactionary. As in the comment you cite \u2013 Henri put some words in Keith\u2019s mouth, Keith disavowed them, and you enter the fray with \u201cDiscourses are not only something that academics elucidate and reveal to us great untutored masses\u201c. Now that\u2019s intemperate \u2013 what gives with all this snottiness in place of argument?\nHi, Adam. First, let me correct my mistake, it was Keith @233 I quoted. My point remains. That was not snotty although I was sarcastic in response to the usually more reasonable Lemuel Pitkin. Keith claims that no one has done any such thing in so many words. No, no one has been that blunt in those exact terms but a whole string of comments and references amount to the same thing. And I rather suspect that you are familiar enough with the construction of discourses to know that very well. The other Henry didn\u2019t say to someone \u201cgo kill the damn priest,\u201d it was hardly necessary. However, I\u2019m glad to learn that we\u2019ve evolved enough to merely be reactionaries.\nHenri put some words in Keith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mouth\nIt wasn\u2019t me, actually; I think I more or less successfully managed to avoid sarcasm and"
"influences working again this company and trying to damage it.\nAnother much discussed short backed manipulation if NFI (now NOVS.PK), but I wasn\u2019t significantly invested \u2026 so I don\u2019t know the details.\nWhy not also look at the tricks to manipulate stocks up??? Its not only short manipulation but also short squeeze manipulation which gets almost ZERO attention.\nHenry, there has never been a real short squeeze in our capital markets.. NEVER. The SEC would not allow it!!! Do your homework. And don\u2019t try the Volkswagon bit!!!\nI\u2019m not so sure Sean, I found the whole recent Volkswagen story to be pretty relevant. I don\u2019t think it supports an argument towards upside manipulation, and I agree if it had happened with American companies inside of American borders that the situation would certainly have turned out differently. But I do think it demonstrates a remarkable example of a case where the bad guys, despite all of their shadowy efforts and shady tricks, lost out (BIG) on what they must have thought was a sure thing. I brought it up in a post above because I believe there was a heavy amount of naked short selling going on, there is simply no other way to explain such a major spike in the price of a stock other than that the naked shorts were scrambling to cover their positions at market value to try to stop the bleeding (if they had done a pre-locate on the stocks they had already sold short, or hedged their positions with options, the price would never have surged like it did). Plus I get a HUGE kick out of all the whining and crying that the hedgies did following the squeeze (hedge funds complaining about a lack of disclosure\u2026Mr. Pot, there is a Mr. Kettle here who would like to talk to you).\nHenry, I certainly do not doubt that there is plenty of upside manipulation going on in our markets today, but this site is dedicated to covering the topic of naked short selling. Like an ER doctor, triage forces us to focus on the patient in front of us with a sucking chest wound before we can worry about the guy in the waiting room who cut off his finger with a power tool.

At the same time, the subsidy should deliver incentives for competitive entry in those areas.\nAlthough the new revenue charge may result in local rate increases for some consumers, it is expected to foster competition which will benefit local service customers.

"doom; it was an old eucalyptus with long, heavy, fragile branches, and in truth a danger as much to their own house as to the brutal new one next door. \"We'll have to refinance; there's no other way,\" Ralph said. Richards, the lawyer friend, concurred that the destruction of the tree was unavoidable. In the end, the neighbors, who had somehow heard of the older couple's financial worries, again offered to pay half of the cost, as long as Betty and Ralph would grant them contractual right of first refusal should they ever decide to sell their own house. The younger couple envisioned a tennis court on the lot. Betty and Ralph discussed it long and bitterly, but in the end they agreed, understanding that their only other choice was to sell out right away, an option which tempted them. Their children were in no position to help them with money.\nSoon men with chainsaws arrived, accompanied by a crane, and after four days of intense noise, the tree was gone, leaving only chips and twigs and a circle of rumpled soil by the back fence. The sky seemed unnaturally bare now when they glanced out the back window, so they chose not to look. The back yard, which Ralph had habitually tended with a vigorous delicacy, grew ragged, grass stems poking out tall and thin among the jagged leaves of the dandelions, with rangy milk thistles springing up where the flowers had died off late in the summer. One rainy day in the middle of October Betty called Ralph to the kitchen window, which offered a view of the half-forgotten yard. \"Look who's back,\" she told Ralph, who had come unwillingly from his computer screen in the darkened study, where he now spent what Betty felt was too much time. Ralph straightened his glasses and looked out the window while Betty smiled at him. Soon he smiled too. \"I'll be damned. It's the Gang of Four, isn't it?\"\n\"Hard to tell,\" Betty said, \"But they sure act like it.\" The four crows poked their beaks peaceably into tangles of grass stem as rain pattered downward from a soft gray sky.\n\"Wonder"

"; Stein, C Michael; Girard, Timothy D\nObjective To characterize fentanyl population pharmacokinetics in patients with critical illness and identify patient characteristics associated with altered fentanyl concentrations. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Medical and surgical ICUs in a large tertiary care hospital in the United States. Patients Patients with acute respiratory failure and/or shock who received fentanyl during the first five days of their ICU stay. Measurements and Main Results We collected clinical and hourly drug administration data and measured fentanyl concentrations in plasma collected once daily for up to five days after enrollment. Among 337 patients, the mean duration of infusion was 58 hours at a median rate of 100 \u00c2\u00b5g/hr. Using a nonlinear mixed-effects model implemented by NONMEM, we found fentanyl pharmacokinetics were best described by a two-compartment model in which weight, severe liver disease, and congestive heart failure most affected fentanyl concentrations. For a patient population with a mean weight of 92 kg and no history of severe liver disease or congestive heart failure, the final model, which performed well in repeated 10-fold cross-validation, estimated total clearance (CL), intercompartmental clearance (Q), and volumes of distribution for the central (V1) and peripheral compartments (V2) to be 35 (95% confidence interval: 32 to 39) L/hr, 55 (42 to 68) L/hr, 203 (140 to 266) L, and 523 (428 to 618) L, respectively. Severity of illness was marginally associated with fentanyl pharmacokinetics but did not improve the model fit after liver and heart disease were included. Conclusions In this study, fentanyl pharmacokinetics during critical illness were strongly influenced by severe liver disease, congestive heart failure, and weight, factors that should be considered when dosing fentanyl in the ICU. Future studies are needed to determine if data-driven fentanyl dos"

"umber. [1003]And concerning Lazarus, He said to His disciples:--Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I go to waken him. [1004]And the Apostle said:--We shall all sleep, but we shall not all be changed. [1005]And again he said:--Concerning those that sleep, be ye not grieved. [1006]\n19. But it is right for us to be afraid of the second death, [1007] that which is full of weeping and gnashing of teeth, and of groanings and miseries, that which is situated in outer darkness. But blessed shall be the faithful and the righteous in that Resurrection, in which they expect to be awakened and to receive the good promises made them. But as for the wicked who are not faithful, in the Resurrection woe to them, because of that which is laid up for them! It would be better for them according to the faith which they possess, were they not to arise. For the servant, for whom his Lord is preparing stripes and bonds, while he is sleeping desires not to awake, for he knows that when the dawn shall have come and he shall awake, his Lord will scourge and bind him. But the good servant, to whom his Lord has promised gifts, looks expectantly for the time when dawn shall come and he shall receive presents from his Lord. And even though he is soundly sleeping, in his dream he sees something like what his Lord is about to give him, whatsoever He has promised him, and he rejoices in his dream, and exults, and is gladdened. As for the wicked, his sleep is not pleasant to him, for he imagines that lo! the dawn has come for him, and his heart is broken in his dream. But the righteous sleep, and their slumber is pleasant to them, in the day-time and the night-time, and they take no thought of all that long night, and like one hour is it accounted in their eyes. Then in the watch of the dawn they awake with joy. But as for the wicked, their sleep lies heavy upon them, and they are like a man who is laid low by a great and deep fever"

For most visitors, the star attractions are Figueira\u2019s outlandishly wide beach and a casino featuring big-name acts on summer evenings. The local sands are so vast that it takes a five-minute walk across creaky boardwalks simply to reach the sea. Out of season, the place has a lonelier charm, but come here in summer and things are upbeat, with sizzling bodies and candy-striped beach huts filling every square inch of beach.\nWith a warren of narrow, cobbled lanes running down to a wide, cliff-backed beach, Nazar\u00e9 is a beautifully picturesque coastal resort. The sands are packed wall- to-wall with multicoloured umbrellas in July and August and the town centre is jammed with seafood restaurants, bars and local women in traditional dress near the seafront at Av da Rep\u00fablica. To get a different perspective, take the funicular railway, built in 1893, up to Promont\u00f3rio do S\u00edtio, where incredible wow factor coastal views unfold from the cliffs.\nNazar\u00e9 has hit the headlines in recent years for the monster world record-breaking waves off the town\u2019s north beach which attracts surfers from around the world. If you take a trip to the Promont\u00f3rio do S\u00edtio you can walk along to the headland for great views and photo opportunities of the surfers.\nS\u00e3o Martinho do Porto\nIn contrast to nearby Nazar\u00e9, S\u00e3o Martinho do Porto is not so busy, but somewhere frequented by families to enjoy the gentle lap of the waves on the scallop shaped bay ringed by safe white sanded beaches. The bay is only connected to the sea by an opening of a few meters, hence the reason the waters are sheltered making it also ideal for sailing, windsurfing or kayaking. The beach frontage has numerous cafes, restaurants and terraces to enjoy after a relaxing day on the beach.\nPopular for its long, fabulous town beach and where you can get a boat to the beautiful Ilhas Berlengas nature reserve, Peniche is spectacularly set on a headland with the sea on all sides."
"unreliability, with understanding that not all errors are equally important and meaningful in repeated-measures design\", and again highlight this in the subsection \u201cAn Empirical Example: Myelin Water Fraction Data from Arshad et al. (2017)\u201d, last paragraph. However, these benefits are already present in ANOVA-based ICC. Generalizability Theory (G-Theory; Webb and Shavelson, 2005) has been used in neuroimaging to decompose error into constituent sources and re-estimate ICCs (e.g., Gee et al., 2015, Noble et al., 2017). Despite this crucial point, the authors only mention G-Theory in the third paragraph of the subsection \u201cWhen the true scores are changing: Extending ICED to growth curve modeling\u201d. From a practical standpoint, the estimates of the ICC2 are very similar to the estimates of Arshad et al. (2017). Although they use a subset of the data to estimate back-to-back versus repositioned ICCs, this can be estimated with the full data and an ANOVA using G-Theory.\nWhile the authors state another motivating virtue \u2013 the ability to use \"likelihood ratio tests to efficiently assess whether individual variance components significantly differ from zero\" \u2013 they do not acknowledge that this is also possible in a traditional ANOVA framework, e.g., via simple F-test.\nThe value of this approach, which should be at the heart of its motivation, is that it provides a theoretically more valid way of estimating error from multiple sources, particularly in complex and time-dependent designs. The ANOVA and repeated-measures ANOVA become increasingly invalid with the complexity of the design. In addition, the SEM framework allows the user to test different assumptions about the structure of the model (e.g., tau-equivalent vs. con-generic). The aforementioned subsection starts to hint at this, though this should be the core feature throughout. Note however, that this is a theoretical argument; it is difficult to demonstrate the \"utility\" of this method over the simpler ANOVA, especially for simpler designs where the gains may be small.\n2) Subsection \u201cIntra-class effect decomposition (ICED)\u201d,"

So up, and actually a lot of variety of chemicals are often referred to as soup including gasoline.\nMB: There's an expression that I love in Spanish estado esta en la saba, which means to be even in the soup, and you use this when you're describing something or someone that you see once and then you see it everywhere.

"1998\nAbstract: I consider some standard engineering definitions of hazard, accident and risk, and show on a simple example how the definitions of hazard and risk are deficient. (HTML, 35K)\nFormale Bescreibung von DATR\nAbstract: The question of deriving a provably-correct implementation of the pure inheritance language DATR is considered. First one must have a semantics, with which to prove the implementation consistent. We consider the denotational semantics of William Keller, critique it and present our own improved version. Although it is in principle possible to derive an implementation direct from the denotational semantics, it is unlikely to be efficient, for reasons we enumerate. We thus define a Natural Semantics (\u00e0 la Kahn), a collection of rewrite rules. We have validated this semantics by implementing it in the theorem prover Isabelle (see Executing DATR Programs with a Prover, below) and comparing the output or the prover with the intuitively intended output of a variety of simple DATR programs. This Isabelle implementation is briefly described, but its technical description will appear in further work. It is relatively efficient.\n[ Thesis, PS, 275K gzipped ]\nExecuting DATR Programs with a Prover\nAbstract: A natural semantics (\u00e0 la Kahn) was written for programs in DATR, a pure inheritance language originally devised by Gazdar for use in computational phonology. This semantics was implemented as an `object logic' in the metalogic of the Isabelle theorem prover (from Paulson). DATR programs are thus evaluated by theorem-proving in Isabelle. This has two advantages: firstly, comparing this method with the output of other DATR compilers is a way of checking the correctness of the semantic rules; second, assuming the soundness of Isabelle, the evaluation is guaranteed correct (by contsruction) for the rules, and therefore if there is confidence in the soundness of the rules, this is a guaranteed-correct compiler for DATR, against which other implementations may be compared for correctness.

I define both, consistently with the way that engineers, computer scientists, and formal logicians use the terms. I propose that both abstractions and models have what Searle calls an agentive function"

". It is certainly a heavy load to carry around with you. It preys on your conscience and when you weaken it can pull you down.\nWhat a strange thing to say when her confidant and best friend is wife of an Anglican Priest!\nReligious ... Kate and Gerry in church\nThat said, the knowledge that I am a stronger and more able woman now than I was a couple of years ago helps me to shake off a little of that guilt: I recognise this is a positive development, for me, for Gerry, for Sean and Amelie, and for Madeleine.\nDECEMBER 4 2010: We went to the Leicestershire and Rutland Irish Golf Society dinner dance last night (the proceeds were being donated to Madeleine\u2019s Fund.) It was a really good \u201cdo\u201d \u2014 lovely people and great music.\nGerry and I danced for a large part of the evening. We hadn\u2019t danced since Madeleine was taken. We actually enjoyed it. It felt a little strange but I wasn\u2019t consumed with guilt as is often the case in these situations.\nOur pain might be the most acute, but our whole family, as well as our closest friends, suffer it to some degree, too, every day. So many people miss Madeleine \u2014 their granddaughter, sibling, niece, cousin, godchild and friend \u2014 and of course they worry about Gerry and me. We all have our own needs and cannot always deal with each other\u2019s. This has been very hard for us \u2014 especially given the incredible support our family and friends have been throughout the last four years.\nI own up that my expectations of others have sometimes been too high. Early on, friends and relatives were there for us constantly, devoting their time and resources to anything that might help find Madeleine.\nInevitably, as time moves on, motivation wanes, priorities change and people have their own lives to lead. This is only natural. But while I understand that, at times it makes me sad that anyone else is capable of switching off when Madeleine is still missing. And I suppose I envy them their freedom to do so.\nCertain reactions to our situation have been hard to deal with.\nFor some people it seems too pain"
"famously worthless marks.\nAlthough Weimar\u2019s woes were many, two of the most pertinent were that the Kaiser borrowed immensely to fund his armies, whose victories were supposed to enable him to repay his nation\u2019s debts, and that the Western allies bled defeated Germany\u2019s resources dry, thus opening the way for Herr Hitler once Weimar fell. Europe\u2019s central banks are following this very policy today. They are doling out billions to ease energy bills, to bribe farmers and, most notoriously, to feed the money laundering Ponzi scheme that is Zelensky\u2019s Kiev junta. The money supply, at more than 15 trillion euros, is at record levels and real interest rates are in negative terrain, pauperizing pensioners but failing to kick start their fuel starved economies. Inflation,.Germany\u2019s bane, is again on the march as too far much money is in search of far too few bags of fire wood; and English toilet paper has increased in price by 50% in the last few months, Albion is really in squeaky bum time.\nAs the European Central Bank\u2019s leaders presently have no other card to play, they must think their printing presses are enough to prevail in Ukraine and to allow Europeans to both eat and heat themselves this winter. Not only is that wishful thinking on the part of ECB President Christine Lagarde, the \u2018multi cultural\u2019 Parisian, who previously fronted the IMF and who held senior Ministerial positions in the French government but it betrays her fundamental ignorance about monetary policy. The main aim of the euro was to have the stability of the German mark and the Dutch guilder and not to be as volatile as Lagarde\u2019s French franc, which was devalued four times since 1945. Unlike Lagarde, the Central Bank of the Federal Republic of Germany, along with that of Japan, seemed to have understood monetary policy, which is best seen as being like the throttle of a motorbike which must, when necessary, allow more fuel to enter the economic engine but which also must not flood it by drowning it in Zimbabwean dollars, French francs, Confederate Greybacks or Lagardean euros.\n"

"\nYou should be aware, however, that Peru is still a broadly Catholic conservative country, and attitudes towards the gay community often reflect Catholic teachings.

Sadly, two-thirds of lawmakers in Parliament recently voted in favour of removing anti-discrimination laws, though this hasn\u2019t come into effect.

"particularly proud of his membership of the MCC at Lords. The first letter is an A.L.s dated 29 November 1947 and written on the stationery of London's prestigious Athenaeum Club. The letter confirms that Wavell will propose the toast at the Buccaneers' annual dinner (held at Lords). The second letter is a T.L.s. dated 23 December 1949 and written on printed stationery from Wavell's residence at 23 Kingston House South in London's Kensington. This time the letter declines Moore's invitation to attend the annual dinner, but carries Wavell's best wishes to the club for the coming year during which he hopes to see them in action. Both letters are signed simply 'Wavell' in the writer's usual manner. Field-Marshal Earl Wavell (1883-1950) was one of the twentieth century's most distinguished soldiers. Following considerable success against the Italians in North Africa, his career reached its peak with his appointment as Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific, ABDA (American, British, Dutch and Australian) Command in 1942 and subsequently as an outstanding Viceroy and Governor General of India from 1943-1947. He was recognised also as a scholar, compiling the well-known anthology of poetry 'Other Mens's Flowers' (1944). The bulk of Wavell's papers are now housed in the Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives at King's College, London. Founded in 1930, The Buccaneers is one of the oldest and most famous 'wandering' clubs in English cricket (a 'wandering' club has no fixed home ground but plays consistently as an 'away' team relying on the hospitality of the 'home' clubs against which it competes). The Club's history has been written twice, by Clifford Bax in 1956 and more recently by Howard Spencer. ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS SIGNED BY WAVELL ARE EXTREMELY SCARCE. (Book ref. 9854) \u00a31260.00\nCR"
"all of this can be a deluded pipe dream of a brain in a vat!\nIt cannot ground certainty!\nOf course the first thing to be said of a deluded brain in a vat or the like, is that we are undeniably self aware, so the making of an error is not able to overturn that fact.\nThe second, is that when we have made an error, we face the situation that the error is detectable by leading to patent absurdity, when we are dealing with self-evident truths. As our child found out.\nIndeed, let us imagine the child is a figment of imagination, in some dream state that we mistakenly think is real. Did that make 3 = 4, that it is not an extra-mental operation? Nope, even in the dream world, 3 = 4 is a mistake.\nSo, let us imagine further, that the dream is at another level, so that we cannot even perceive the difference between ||| and ||||, not even by the dream child putting the two together and seeing one is extra.\nWhat have we implied here? That error exists. (Which directly entails that the denial of this claim, is an error, or at least that he conjunction of E and its denial ~E would be an error. But, we don\u2019t know that LNC holds in all cases! \u2014 usually announced as a triumphant dismissal of an Aristotelian, black and white thinking ignoramus. Oops, an error, as to make the symbolic representation to so object, you have had to build on the foundation of identity and world partition, thus LOI, LNC and LEM, which you would deny \u2014 i.e. contradict and assert it is not the case that. And, to be aware to do so, you are already in a state of distinct identity, thence again the applicability of LOI, LNC, LEM. And the incoherence leads to reduction to patent self-refuting absurdity. You may cling to absurdity if you want. We will know to ring fence you off as a clinger to the absurd, undermining self awareness, ability to communicate,and to be reasonable in the real world.

"along microtubules throughout the cell. No differences were apparent between unconjugated F5 WT and Lckoff CTLs.\nUpon interaction with targets, T cells receive a stop signal, and the cells round up as they form conjugates (Negulescu et al., 1996; Dustin et al., 1997). This was apparent in EM images from both WT and Lckoff CTLs (Fig. 4 C). In EM images of WT CTLs, the centrosome was often in contact with the plasma membrane, which we refer to as docking, and was separated from the nuclear envelope. The MTOC and associated organelles radiated out from this point and had the appearance of streaming toward the point of centrosome contact with the plasma membrane (docking). Lytic granules also focused toward the point of centrosome contact at the plasma membrane. All of these organelles appeared to be aligned along microtubules, which converged at the centrosome (Fig. 4 C, WT).\nIn EM images of conjugates formed by F5 Lckoff CTLs, the centrosome was located between the nucleus and the synapse but was not in contact with the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 C). The centrosome appeared closer to the nucleus than in WT conjugates, although not as close as in the rounded nonmigratory cells (Fig. 4 A). The microtubule-associated organelles radiated out from the centrosome but lacked the streaming organization seen in WT CTL conjugates, with lytic granules dispersed throughout the cell (Fig. 4 C, Lckoff).\nTo verify the defect in centrosome docking in Lckoff CTLs at a higher resolution, we quantitated centrosome docking at the plasma membrane from electron micrographs prepared from samples in which CTLs were allowed to conjugate for 20, 40, or 60 min. Only sections in which at least one of the centrioles and a clear synapse were seen were counted. Centrioles have approximate dimensions of 0.45 \u00d7 0.2 \u00b5m.

The expression of the former group was greatly suppressed, while that of the latter group was dramatically induced at 24\u2009h of PEG treatment. There were 5 lncRNAs in group M5, of which the genes were significantly enriched in lipid metabolism, degradation of major carbohydrate (CHO) metabolism, calvin cycle and light reaction, secondary metabolism, light signaling, and tetrapyrrole synthesis. The genes included in group M6 were significantly enriched in amino acid synthesis, lipid metabolism, secondary metabolism of wax, and abiotic stress, but none of lncRNAs were included in this group (Fig. 4b).\nThe genes/lncRNAs from group M7 to M8 were highly expressed in BL (Fig. 4a). Similar to group M5 and M6, the former group was greatly decreased whereas the latter group was significantly increased at 24\u2009h of PEG treatment. There were 13 lncRNAs in group M7, of which the enriched categories included synthesis of major CHO metabolism, trehalose metabolism, nitrogen (N)-metabolism, photosynthesis, redox, secondary metabolism of flavonoids, and light signaling. There was only one lncRNA in group M8, and this group was significantly enriched in protein assembly and cofactor ligation (Fig. 4b).\nThe genes/lncRNAs from group M9 to M11 were highly expressed in RT (Fig. 4a).

"Attempts.\nHe left France after he had been there Eleven Years, and returned into Holland full of Hopes, by reason of a kind Letter he received from Prince Frederick Henry, who succeeded his Brother in that Republick; but his Enemies prevented the good Effects of that Letter, and therefore he was forced once more to leave his Country; he resolved to go to Hamburg, where he stayed till he accepted the Offers he received from the Crown of Sweden, in the Year 1634. Queen Christina made him one of her Counsellors, and sent him Embassador to Lewis XIII. Having discharged the Duties of that Employment about Eleven Years, he set out from France to give an Account of his Embassy to the Queen of Sweden; he went through Holland, and received many Honours at Amsterdam; he saw Queen Christina at Stockholm, and after he had discoursed with her about the Affairs he had been entrusted with, he most humbly begged of her, that she would grant him his Dismission. The Queen gave him no positive Answer when he asked leave to retire, which displeased some great Men, who were afraid that she would keep him in her Council: He perceived their Discontent, and was so pressing to obtain his Dismission, that it[iv] was granted him at last. The Queen, upon his Departure, gave him several Marks of her great Esteem for him. The Ship on Board which he embarked was violently tost by a Storm on the Coasts of Pomerania; GROTIUS being sick, and uneasy in Mind, continued to travel by Land, but his Illness forced him to stop at Rostock, where he died in a few Days, on the 28th of August 1645.

Mr. Suthep also told supporters that he regularly chatted with the army chief on LINE, a texting application.\nMr. Suthep's comment contradicts the military junta's frequent claim that they did not sides in the political conflict that pitted PCAD protesters and the Democrat Party against supporters of the former government.\nCol. Winthai Suwaree, a spokesman of the military junta's National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), said The Bangkok Post report was false.\n\"I insist that there has been no private talk or communication between Mr. Suthep and Gen. Prayuth,\" Col. Winthai said today. \"The news report might have been [affected by] some misunderstanding,\"\nThe spokesperson also insisted that Gen. Prayuth could not possibly have been plotting a coup against Ms. Yingluck, who was also serving as Minister of Defence, because the army strictly operates within the country's legal framework.\nHowever, supporters of Ms. Yingluck's government and a number of pro-democracy activists have long suspected that Gen.

"several weeks following the Cressy sighting there were numerous reports of strange airborne objects in the Longford, Cressy, Poatina, and Evandale districts.\nIn 1990 TUFOIC obtained copies of the RAAF sighting form completed by Rev Browning but the form was undated.\nProfessor McDonald received a letter from the RAAF officer who did the interrogation of the Brownings. The Brownings impressed the officer as being mature, stable, and mentally alert individuals who had no cause or desire to see objects in the sky other than objects of definite form and substance.\nThe meteorological summary for October 4th describes a small depression over the Central Plateau with a front extending to the east of Flinders Island. Light to moderate rain was experienced ahead of the front with rain clearing after 15.00 (3 pm). However, extensive cloud build up were associated with the trough along the Western Tiers (south-west of Cressy) during the late afternoon. Thunderstorm activity was reported from areas near the Tiers.\nThe RAAF summary explained the case as 'Astronomical\". Moon rise would have been visible shortly after 6pm in an east south east direction; as the objects were seen near the skyline, the moon's reflection on scud type cloud associated with the rain squall were responsible for the sighting.\nRev Browning dismissed the RAAF's explanation. The moon he said would have been competing with a glorious sunset, whilst the easterly skyline was not visible due to rain covering the Ben Lomond area.\nA check reveals that the sun was indeed about to set in the western sky, and if anything would have been the more likely of the two astronomical bodies to light up the sky. Rev Browning told Professor McDonald that the sun was illuminating the objects, there being a distinct difference in tone between the dull grey of the larger object and the shiny, metallic lustre of the smaller disc-like objects. The moon was just rising but at the time of the sighting would have been at a mere 6 degrees to the east. In fact it may have had trouble at that time in being visible over mountains to the east.\nNo mention is made if the Brownings heard the explosions two hours later, nor"

"caricatures of animators - Grim Natwick and Ub Iwerks.\nChina? Shojo manga?

I haven't read the first issue of the comic yet - I'm waiting for the trade as the kids today say.\nAnd in tomorrow's Post (you'll just have to wonder), Michael O'Sullivan has a review of the shojo manga exhibit. I met him at a New Year's Party (namedropping!), introducing myself because he was talking about the excellent Hiroshi Sugimoto exhibit that was at the Hirschhorn Museum last year with another one across the street at the Sackler following close behind it. In tomorrow's review, I think he has this exactly right: Still, one of artist Masako Watanabe's drawings on view, from a comic created for readers (if that's the right word) in their 20s and 30s, features a graphic sex scene more reminiscent of shunga, the erotic variety of ukiyo-e, or traditional woodblock prints. Another image, from \"Chumoncho,\" a comic by the same artist, depicts a murder-suicide by a lovesick courtesan.

"ytoff in a statement from Washington, DC. \u201cThe series of incidents captured in this report are little known and should rightfully be highlighted. Not only do we see the Chinese government violating its own laws, but we also witness the discriminatory environment Uyghurs have to endure in their own homeland. An outbreak of civilian hysteria targeting Uyghurs, mismanaged by the state due to its own suspicion of Uyghurs, led to indiscriminate killings of Uyghurs and politically motivated criminal-judicial procedures. The entire incident is a damning indictment on the Chinese government\u2019s ethnic policies.\u201d\nOn September 3, 2009, Han Chinese residents of Urumchi rallied outside government offices on People\u2019s Square to protest a perceived lack of state inaction over the unrest of July 5 that year and a spate of alleged pinprick attacks that began the previous month.\nThe alleged attacks took place in the context of an unprecedented 10-month communications blackout in East Turkestan. Since the July 2009 unrest, the Internet, international dialing and personal texting had been cut in the region. Chinese authorities maintained near absolute control over the content of information and its transmission. When rumors began to spread that perpetrators of pinprick attacks in Urumchi were transmitting infectious and fatal diseases through syringes, hysteria among residents in the city reached dangerous levels. As the agency in control of the flow of information and the welfare of all citizens in East Turkestan, the Chinese government mismanaged growing hysteria, which led to, UHRP has learned, indiscriminate killing and beating of Uyghurs. UHRP is unaware of any investigation into violence carried out by Han Chinese or criminal charges stemming from these credible allegations.\nChinese officials throughout the alleged pinprick attacks did not move quickly enough to calm down panic amongst Han Chinese in Urumchi through a reasoned explanation of claims made by supposed victims. In its research, UHRP found that no alleged victim was infected with any disease and many of the cases reported in the official media did not result in a credible claim of a criminal act.\nUHRP believes"

"diagnosis, and treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.\nAs the Gairdner award states:\nDr. John Dick made the first discovery of leukemia stem cells (LSC) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. This finding established that individual cancer cells in the patient are not equal, rather they are organized as a cellular hierarchy where only rare leukemia cells possess self-renewal, the hallmark stem cell property. This discovery required two experimental components that Dick developed: a xenograft assay to detect LSC based on their ability to generate human leukemia upon transplantation into immune-deficient mice and a method to purify leukemia cells into LSC and non-LSC populations. By combining functional LSC assays with genetic analysis, Dick tracked the complex evolutionary pathways of human leukemia development from normal blood stem cells to pre-leukemic stem cells that eventually generate LSC and AML up to a decade later. This work also showed that LSCs that can cause later relapse have already evolved prior to diagnosis and can survive normal therapy procedures. Thus, LSC was directly linked to therapy failure and relapse in leukemia patients. The properties of LSC as reflected in their gene expression are predictive of therapy response and overall survival. Dick developed a 17-gene \u2018stemness score\u2019 that can be used clinically to determine the patient\u2019s risk of poor outcome and help guide therapeutic choice.\nThe impact:\nDick\u2019s discovery of LSC changed the understanding of the underlying biology of cancer and stimulated the exploration of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in other human cancers, including those affecting the breast, brain, colon, pancreas, skin, and liver. His work highlighted the importance of investigating the properties of individual cells of the neoplastic clone, rather than bulk cancer cells and that special attention needs to be on the CSC which are the only cells capable of long-term cancer propagation. The focus on CSC is revealing a number of properties that enable their survival in the face of therapy including dormancy, stress signaling as well as stemness programs that enable disease recurrence. Dick\u2019s work points to the need to ensure that CSC are er"

Prior to this, there will be four forums covering youth, women, business and civil society, as well as ministerial meetings and several side events.\nHigh-level sessions and ministerial meetings at CHOGM take place behind closed doors; however, there will be pool opportunities for media at the start of sessions.\nMedia Pools\nMedia pools at CHOGM are the responsibility of the Commonwealth Secretariat, managed through a central system supported by Secretariat staff and the Host Country taskforce.\nPool size will be determined by venue size and security factors. We will endeavour to make them as large as possible.\nRepresentation: To ensure media from all member countries are given fair access, the pool system is designed to be as representative as possible of regions, countries, broadcasters and agencies. In practice this means that if space is limited, member states or even regions may only receive one pool space on particular pool.\nApplication process: A list of each pooled CHOGM event will be made available at the Media Centre reception desk from Sunday 19 June, when the Media Centre opens. Journalists are encouraged to apply as soon as possible. Once pools are decided and closed, journalists will be notified if they are part of the pool, or not.\nTransportation for pools: Media will be transported and escorted by staff to and from each pool session.\nSharing material: Media who participate in pools are required to hand over their footage to the pool manager immediately on their return to the Media Centre for download and onward sharing. This is a condition of being accepted onto a pool.\nRBA footage: the host government has appointed the Rwanda Broadcasting Agency (RBA) to film all open events. Their material will be made available to all journalists/outlets and there are no restrictions in terms of use by accredited CHOGM journalists. However, you must credit this material to RBA.\nOpening Ceremony (24 June)\nMedia access to the official Opening Ceremony will be restricted to an accompanied media pool determined by regional representation.

"hurricane phenomenon, which allows further research. Five parameters i.e. characteristics of solar activity (10.7 cm solar radio flux (F10.7), the flows of protons and electrons with maximum energy, speed and density of solar wind particles) were chosen as model input, while the wind speed and air pressure of Irma, Jose, and Katia hurricanes were used as model output. Input data were sampled to a six hours interval in order to adapt the time interval to the observed data about hurricanes, in the period between September 28 and December 21, 2017. As a result of the preliminary analysis, using 12,274,264 linear models by parallel calculations, six of them were chosen as best. The identified lags were the basis for refinement of models with the artificial neural networks. Multilayer perceptrons with back propagation and recurrent LSTM have been chosen as commonly used artificial neural networks. Comparison of the accuracy of both linear and artificial neural networks results confirmed the adequacy of these models and made it possible to take into account the dynamics of the solar wind. Sensitivity analysis has shown that F10.7 has the greatest impact on the wind speed of the hurricanes. Despite low sensitivity of pressure to change the parameters of the solar wind, their strong fluctuations can cause a sharp decrease in pressure, and therefore the appearance of hurricanes.\nPB  - Switzerland : Springer Nature\nT2  - Astrophysics and Space Science\nT1  - Space weather and hurricanes Irma, Jose and Katia\nIS  - 154\nDO  - 10.1007/s10509-019-3646-5\nauthor = \"Vyklyuk, Yaroslav and Radovanovi\u0107, Milan M. and Milovanovi\u0107, Bo\u0161ko and Milenkovi\u0107, Milan and Petrovi\u0107, Marko and Doljak, Dejan and Malinovi\u0107-Mili\u0107evi\u0107, Slavica and Vukovi\u0107, Natalia and Vujko, Aleksandra and Matsiuk, Nataliia and Mukherjee, Saumitra\",\nabstract = \"This research is devoted to the determination of the causal relationship between the flow of particles that"

"ably, a player in development (Image credit: Tom Flathers/Manchester City FC via Getty Images)\nGuardiola clashed with a physical goalscorer like Ibrahimovic. Manchester United were ultimately better off before and after CR7. It's easy to forget \u2013 but Erling Braut Haaland is still just 22 and he's nothing like the other two, despite comparisons.\nWhen the Norwegian rocked up in the Premier League, he said he was there to learn from Pep \u2013 and that's a key word that certainly suggests not just humility but an acceptance that he'll adapt in England and change as a player. Haaland must have an ego \u2013 all good strikers do \u2013 but he's young, made good decisions so far in his career and could yet evolve to be a better-rounded frontman. This isn't a case of a team desperate for goals, attaching their sails to a pirate who can hold them to ransom: Haaland needs City as much City need him. It seems like the player himself recognises that.\nAnd it's safe to say that the experiment is working on the whole. The Citizens might be two points down on last season but they're five goals up. Haaland has 21 goals and three assists in just 16 games, delivering at a rate that not even Ibra or Ronaldo could offer in return for a one-dimensional playing style.\nManchester City are still good with Haaland (obviously) and still good without Haaland (also obviously)\nNo Haaland, no problem (Image credit: Manchester City FC via Getty Images)\nConsider how important Kevin De Bruyne was to Manchester City when they racked up 100 points 2017/18. Now consider that they managed 98 points a year later, almost entirely without KDB and Bernardo Silva in his position instead. The truth is that City rarely miss anyone \u2013 however good they are \u2013 and that Haaland isn't so much as an integral part of a system but just one of many weapons in a Swiss Army Knife.\nManchester City lined up against Chelsea in the Premier League with what looked like a back three in possession, Rodri dropping into the backline: that was switched at half-time, easily."

"of analytical techniques (including scanning electron microscopy, optical microscopy, chemical analysis and pH determination). The samples were also subjected to a range of physical tests. Most of the samples examined were very weak and porous although they had retained full structural integrity. With the exception of the 19th century sample, none of the concretes had maintained pH alkaline enough to immobilize radionuclides. Hydrated calcium silicates have been detected in some samples which are similar to those observed in modern Portland cement concretes. These stable cementitious species have endured for almost two thousand years. All the ancient concretes and mortars examined contained natural pozzolanic material or crushed burnt clay. This may have had some effect on the reduction in alkalinity although the main reason was full carbonation of calcium hydroxide\nEffect of shear span, concrete strength and strrup spacing on behavior of pre-stressed concrete beams\nAhmad, S.; Bukhari, I.A.\nThe shear strength of pre-stressed concrete beams is one of the most important factors to be considered in their design. The available data on shear behavior of pre-tensioned prestressed concrete beams is very limited. In this experimental study, pre-tensioned prestressed concrete I-beams are fabricated with normal and high- strength concretes, varying stirrup spacing and shear span-to-depth ratios. 1Wenty one I-beam specimens that are 300 mm deep and 3745-4960mm long are tested up to failure while deflections, cracking pattern, cracking and failure loads were recorded. The research results are compared with ACI 318-02 and Structure Analysis Program, Response 2000. It was observed that with the decrease in concrete strength, failure mode of prestressed concrete beams changes from flexure shear to web shear cracking for values of shear span-to-depth ratio less than 4.75. Increase in stirrup spacing decreased the effectiveness of stirrups in transmitting shear across crack as a result of which failure mode is changed to web shear cracking especially for beams with lower values of she"

"new samples around, Blowtorch didn't get much use. I had so many other new figures that I never really utilized the figure as much as I wanted.\nThen, I found the Plastirama figures. Seeing my childhood favorites in slightly altered colors was interesting as it made these old figures new again. I set about acquiring all of the Plastirama figures that were readily available and picked up most of the line in fairly short order. Among these was the Antorcha figure. The deeper yellow and red colors combined with the sunburned skin tone really made the figure pop to me. It brought the Blowtorch character back into my collection in a new way that was fresher than a 20 year old retread. Now, that's my enjoyment of the figure. He's a different way to display and showcase Blowtorch. Anyone who sees him knows that he is Blowtorch, but also notices that he's a bit different.\nPlastirama used the Blowtorch mold three times. In the regular carded line, the exclusive TNT figure is the most famous usage. The Backstop figure included with the Persuader was the second. The final was, basically, just a slightly redone American Blowtorch named Antorcha. All three figures used the full Blowtorch mold with the exception of the waist piece. Instead of Blowtorch's waist, the figures all use the waist from Doc. Visually, it's not really important, except that Doc's waist is a bit smaller than Blowtorch's. So, the figure appears a bit out of a balance as you have a bulky chest flowing into a skinny waist that then expands into puffier legs than were designed for the waist. As such, you have to be careful as quick, harsh movements can snap Antorcha's crotch instantly. You see large quantities of Antorcha figures from childhood Argentina collections with broken crotch pieces.\nAntorcha's accessories are different from the American Blowtorch's. Well, at least partly. The backpack and airmask are the same and are in the same, yellow color as the US figure. Antorcha's helmet, though, is not the traditional Blowtorch"
"ided at Friday\u2019s meeting.\nWhile the analysis showed a $52 million surplus before Irma, it projected shortfalls of nearly $1.15 billion during the 2019-2020 fiscal year and $1.64 billion during the 2020-2021 year.\nBaker said the key to the projected $52 million surplus was a gambling deal that Gov. Rick Scott reached with the Seminole Tribe of Florida this summer. She said the effect of the deal was to \u201cflood in\u201d $550.7 million for the coming year.\nBut Baker said analyses of past hurricanes have shown that the state spends significantly more on storm costs than it gets in additional tax dollars related to rebuilding. As examples, she said big state expenditures after hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 included beach-restoration costs and state matching funds to draw down money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nShe said economists each year keep in mind \u201cblack swans\u201d \u2013 events that are unlikely to happen but have high costs. Irma is such an event.\n\u201cNormally, black swans are forward-looking, but this one has arrived,\u201d Baker said.\nLawmakers, who will start the 2018 legislative session in January, will have a variety of potential options for balancing the budget.

Description: The contagion effect explains the possibility of spread of economic crisis or boom across countries or regions.\nThere is no firm rule that says an essay needs to have a set number of paragraphs, but an essay must be a minimum of three paragraphs. Proponents of the five paragraph essay say that the body text should consist of three paragraphs, but in reality, it\u2019s fine to write more or fewer paragraphs in this section.\nExperts believe that negative emotions, like pain, fear and sadness, are more contagious than positive ones. This can be traced back to our survival instinct. Your brain pays more attention to negative emotions because it\u2019s wired to keep you safe.\nFeel like emotional labor may be taking a toll on your job satisfaction?

Emotional labor increases perceptions of job stress, decreases satisfaction, and increases distress.\nSurface acting involves faking the required emotions: that is, when people engage in surface acting, they do not actually try to feel the emotions they wish to portray.

"-based models to reduce the side effect of an unbalanced distribution of wind radii and developed an asymmetric TC wind radius estimation model globally. The comparison of model results with the best-track data of TCs shows that the MAEs of 34-kt wind radius are 18.8, 19.5, 18.6, and 18.8 n mi (1 n mi = 1.852 km) for the northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest quadrants, respectively. The MAEs of 50-kt wind radius are 11.3, 11.3, 11.1, and 10.8 n mi, respectively, and the MAEs of 64-kt wind radius are 8.9, 9.9, 9.2, and 8.7 n mi, respectively. These results represent a 12.1%\u201335.5% improvement over existing methods in the literature. In addition, the DL-based models were interpreted with two deep visualization toolboxes. The results indicate that the TC eye, cloud, and TC spiral structure are the main factors that affect the model performance.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-22-0166.1\nDynamics of the Transient Negative Eddy Response to Zonal-Mean Zonal Wind Variations\nDavid J. Lorenz\nMany studies have focused on the long-term positive feedback between annular mode zonal wind (U) perturbations and the eddy momentum fluxes (M). Lagged correlation analysis between U and M anomalies, however, shows that a transient period of negative eddy forcing follows the peak in zonal wind anomalies. This negative forcing is more ubiquitous than the positive feedback because it occurs for all U EOFs not just EOF1. It has been hypothesized that this response is either 1) an intrinsic feature of the eddies independent of the U or 2) caused by U-induced changes in Rossby wave reflection. Here it is shown that the response can be reproduced in a GCM by imposing a rapid change in U; therefore, mechanism 1 does not appear to be relevant. Furthermore, the transient"

CITU all India president, K Hemalata hoisted the flag amidst thunderous slogans against the attacks on working class, against divisive communal politics of the governments and against capitalism.

Addressing the conference, she underscored the importance of unifying the working class, intensifying the struggles, defeating neoliberal policies and the communal divisive forces, and the imperialist machinations.\nReception committee president, K Subba Rao, delivering the welcome address appreciated the support extended by all sections of the working class and the people in general for organising this conference.\nTapan Sen, all India general secretary of CITU, invited the guests to the dais.

"\nThanks for all you do Dr. Kendrick. Keep looking for facts (and ultimately the truth). If the SV2 hypothesis is believable, correct, whatever, then what other hypothesis\u2019 were presented, tested and ruled out? I have not seen any other hypothesis\u2019 (chemical, physical, biological, radiological, etc.) ever mentioned.\nMike S. September 3, 2021 at 12:47 pm\nThank you Dr Kendrick. Thank you. Rational thought and the ability to articulate it well are rare these days.\nDavid Redfern September 3, 2021 at 12:49 pm\nMy little hypothesis is that the virus is very real, which is why governments around the world hit the panic button when they found out about it.\nMy belief is the virus accidentally escaped from the Wuhan lab, and as almost every country in the world has some sort of Bio weapons facility (what do we imagine they do at Porten Down, invent knitting patterns?) they very well understood the possibilities of covid 19, just not yet the reality.\nWith the exception of Sweden, almost every civilised country ignored WHO guidelines (and in the UK, our own) not to lockdown, isolate, shut schools, or wear masks because, no one in the know believed covid19 was just a pandemic, for which the guidelines were designed.\nIt therefore got me to wondering if covid was somehow targeted by some sort of biological design, possibly one that hadn\u2019t been completed. Perhaps why there are seemingly inconsistent results between Northern Ireland and England. Maybe it targets \u2018genetically\u2019 English people but not people with red hair. Ridiculous I know, but could a virus be genetically tweaked in some way to target, for example, just the elderly?\nIn which case that confounds my entire hypothesis because, if it was a Bio weapon it would surely be targeted at 18 \u2013 40 year olds \u2013 fighting age. Unless, of course, it was incomplete when it escaped.\nWhich throws up another possibility. Perhaps it was released deliberately and the target all along was the elderly. That might be the proving ground for the genetic targeting of the virus. If it can target them, perhaps it can be tweaked to target"

People lived for thousands of years, many of them quite happily, without squandering resources the way we have in the developed world, the past hundred years or so.\nEarly spring is the time to prune in the orchard.\nIn a series of papers published by the Royal Society, physicists and chemists from some of world\u2019s most respected scientific institutions, including Oxford University and the Met Office, agreed that current plans to tackle global warming are not enough.\nUnless emissions are reduced dramatically in the next ten years the world is set to see temperatures rise by more than 4C (7.2F) by as early as the 2060s, causing floods, droughts and mass migration.\nIt's pure fantasy to think a tree tormented by bark like this can survive very long, let alone produce fruit.\nIn one paper Professor Kevin Anderson, Director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, said the only way to reduce global emissions enough, while allowing the poor nations to continue to grow, is to halt economic growth in the rich world over the next twenty years.\nThis would mean a drastic change in lifestyles for many people in countries like Britain as everyone will have to buy less \u2018carbon intensive\u2019 goods and services such as long haul flights and fuel hungry cars.\nThese seeping blisters are magnets for insect attacks.\nProf Anderson admitted it \u201cwould not be easy\u201d to persuade people to reduce their consumption of goods.\nHe said politicians should consider a rationing system similar to the one introduced during the last \u201ctime of crisis\u201d in the 1930s and 40s.\nMany branches are swathed in this grotesque fungus.\nThis could mean a limit on electricity so people are forced to turn the heating down, turn off the lights and replace old electrical goods like huge fridges with more efficient models.

"who are placed between the two, because of the evil? but there is no use in the good for its own sake.\nThen the final principle of friendship, in which all other friendships terminated, those, I mean, which are relatively dear and for the sake of something else, is of another and a different nature from them. For they are called dear because of another dear or friend. But with the true friend or dear, the case is quite the reverse; for that is proved to be dear because of the hated, and if the hated were away it would be no longer dear.\nVery true, he replied: at any rate not if our present view holds good.\nBut, oh! will you tell me, I said, whether if evil were to perish, we should hunger any more, or thirst any more, or have any similar desire? Or may we suppose that hunger will remain while men and animals remain, but not so as to be hurtful? And the same of thirst and the other desires\u2060\u2014that they will remain, but will not be evil because evil has perished? Or rather shall I say, that to ask what either will be then or will not be is ridiculous, for who knows? This we do know, that in our present condition hunger may injure us, and may also benefit us:\u2060\u2014Is not that true?\nAnd in like manner thirst or any similar desire may sometimes be a good and sometimes an evil to us, and sometimes neither one nor the other?\nTo be sure.\nBut is there any reason why, because evil perishes, that which is not evil should perish with it?\nThen, even if evil perishes, the desires which are neither good nor evil will remain?\nClearly they will.\nAnd must not a man love that which he desires and affects?\nHe must.\nThen, even if evil perishes, there may still remain some elements of love or friendship?\nBut not if evil is the cause of friendship: for in that case nothing will be the friend of any other thing after the destruction of evil; for the effect cannot remain when the cause is destroyed.\nAnd have we not admitted already that the friend loves something for a reason? and at the time of making the admission we were of opinion that the neither good nor evil loves the good because of the evil?\nBut now our view is changed,"

No matter what was going on Thor was the driving force behind the story moving forward. That made the major events in War Of The Realms come across as a payoff to the character arc Thor has been on since Aaron began his run. This was his story as he continued to grow as the God of Thunder.\nNot only was the present day Thor Odinson at the center of the story but we also saw the young Thor, King Thor and Jane Foster\u2019s Thor step up big when all is said and done. Each of these versions of Thor have been a major part of Aaron\u2019s run. By the time War Of The Realms was coming to a close with the action reaching its peak all four versions of Thor came together to defeat the big bad.\nAt the same time the story still maintained the spotlight on the iconic version of Thor Odinson. This was his story as he got the greatest payoff of everyone involved in the story. For a long time Thor has been without his equally iconic Mjolnir hammer. That all changed as when Thor most needed it Mjolnir returned and he was able to lift it up, proving once again he is worthy. When Thor said \u201cWhat I truly am Malekith, now and forevermore is the God of the Unworthy\u201d that felt like the moment Aaron has been building towards since the first issue of his run. It was a full circle moment that showed the growth Thor has had over the last few years of events.\nINCREDIBLE ARTWORK BY RUSSELL DAUTERMAN & MATTHEW WILSON\nBefore working on War Of The Realms, Russell Dauterman\u2019s body of work included stints on Mighty Thor, Nightwing, Cyclops and Supurbia. While his work has always been great War Of The Realms was Dauterman\u2019s coming out party as a powerhouse artist. From the quality to consistency he showed throughout this event"

In line with the colors of the national flag of Qatar, the identity uses maroon as its primary color for all logos and branding.\nThe airline advertises heavily internationally including on international television channels like CNN, and BBC World. The airline\u2019s motto is \u2018The World\u2019s 5-star airline that takes you more personally\u2019, and this is certainly true when it comes to everything they do for their customers and passengers.\nThe word \u2018\u2019QATAR\u2019 occupies the front of the fuselage, using a quite bland font, in huge letters on the livery. The whole logo on the airline portrays the perfect flair and distinctiveness that it deserves. There is a sense of luxury among that design. The grey and maroon colors are adopted from the national flag, and it essentially looks like a large Qatar flag on a plane (with those huge \u2018QATAR\u2019 letters on the front of the fuselage).\nThe Arabic name of the airline \u2018Al Qatariyah\u200e\u2019 is rendered in a much smaller, light grey font is is barely noticeable on the plane.

", what do you think the ALA\u2019s role is in library hiring and employment?\nALA has at least four roles:\nfirst, to provide genuinely useful services for actively job-seeking librarians.\nsecond, to provide a place to size up professional issues \u2013 a head\u2019s up on how to stay employable.\nthird, a place to communicate those new skills and issues to library educators.\nfourth, a voice to advocate for the importance of our professionals generally.\nHow can ALA serve unemployed (or underemployed) librarians?\nALA JobLIST is the right place to start. There are listings there not only of who is hiring, but career assessment tools, job interviews at conferences, ways to link up with recruiters, and more.\nplaces to hang out (inexpensively) and share tips. I note that ALA Think Tank has assumed a lot of this role. And that seems appropriate to me. ALA\u2019s relatively modest staff can\u2019t ensure employment for the thousands of jobseekers. Such services work better \u2013 will be fresher, more current, more alive \u2013 coming from the people who are engaged in the issues, rather than waiting for ALA to create and operate a service. But once those services spring up, ALA should acknowledge them, and work to refer people to them. State library associations \u2013 ALA chapters \u2013 are another important link in this chain of professional engagement.\na more community-focused approach to advocacy. It\u2019s clear that our advocacy efforts over the past 25 years haven\u2019t really worked: while libraries see more and more use, their support has been stagnant or falling. I like the partnership with Harwood Institute, and its exploration of a new role for libraries. Ultimately, I think it helps demonstrate the significance of librarians not just to OUR institution, but to our larger authorizing environment. That\u2019s what keeps jobs coming.\nLIS job hunters are increasingly urged to look outside of libraries to careers in other aspects of information work. Why do you think this is, and should this be an impetus for any particular changes in ALA?\nLibrary skills are broadly applicable to a lot of enterprises. So that makes sense on its own"

"7 Sep\u201310 Oct 2011\nWe organized two consecutive summerschools in the field of geo-biosciences in East Africa, including the disciplines of paleoclimatology, paleontology, paleoanthropology, evolutionary biology, structural geology and geophysics. The summerschool focused on the relationships between the development of extreme relief in the East African Rift system, superposed past climate changes and their influence on mammalian and hominin evolution. The transdisciplinary summerschools for students from the fields of geosciences and biosciences aimed at intense training of the participants at the MSc, PhD and postdoctoral level to foster a better understanding of climate-biosphere interactions in a complex tectonic-topographic setting such as the Kenya and Tanzanian rift valley. This effort rested on team teaching and joint learning and will generate important synergies between researchers and graduate students. The acquired knowledge and understanding helped students define premier research topics to study past geo-biosphere interactions, and it ultimately provided the next generation of researchers and practitioners with the necessary background and scientific tools to evaluate and mitigate the effects of present-day and future environmental changes in the course of global change.\nCollecting, Processing and Processing Information in the Geo-Bio-Sciences\nEthiopia 20 Sep\u201311 Oct 2015\nKenya 21 Feb\u201313 Mar 2016\nProf. Dr. Asfawossen Asrat, University of Addis Ababa\nOne of the most valuable skills that experienced and successful scientists can pass on to young researchers is the efficient identification of attractive and relevant research topics in the vast and complex world of science. Our current series of summer schools funded by the VolkswagenFoundation in the bio-geo-sciences aims to help twenty young scientists from African and European universities to design new research projects on such topics using the latest methods of data analysis, and to present the results from these projects in an attractive and professional manner. The first module of the summer school focusses on searching relevant published literature and related data on a scientific topic, using both free and commercially available online citation databases. The aim of this module is to identify scientific hypotheses and controvers"

How can data become spectacular and evocative, physically or digitally, to claim space, to claim time, to demand public attention, and to enact dissent?\nMake a list of the different groups or audiences that you want to move to action and brainstorm multiple forms of data communication tailored for each audience. (For example, if you want to move policy makers to action, one form might be a report with data visualizations. Another form might be oral testimony from impacted communities. Another form might be a visual slideshow with photos, quotes and statistics. Another form might be a protest outside their offices.) Each form is an opportunity to involve different groups in the communication and the circulation of data.\nWhen is it politically advantageous to deploy Donna Haraway's \"god trick\" \u2013 to communicate data neutrally and minimally, as if from an omniscient observer?

Our process entails both qualitative and quantitative analysis to assess the suitability of data products in line with regulatory standards as applicable.\nSustainable investing and understanding of sustainability is evolving along with the data environment. Industry participants, including index providers face challenges in identifying a single metric or set of standardized metrics to provide a complete view on a company or an investment. ESG data sets are constantly changing and improving as disclosure standards, regulatory frameworks and industry practice evolve. There may be some circumstances where data is unavailable, incomplete, or inaccurate. Despite reasonable efforts, information may not always be available in which case an assessment will be made by the index provider based on their knowledge of the investment or industry. In certain cases, data may reflect actions that issuers may have taken only after the fact, and do not reflect all potential instances of significant harm.\nThe Investment Manager carries out due diligence on the index providers and engages with them on an ongoing basis with regard to index methodologies including their assessment of good governance criteria set out by the SFDR which include sound management structures, employee relations, remuneration of staff and tax compliance at the level of investee companies.\nThe Investment Manager does not perform direct engagement with the companies / issuers within the Benchmark Index as part of the investment strategy of the Fund. The Investment Manager will engage directly with the index and data providers to ensure better analytics and stability in ESG metrics. Engagement with companies in which we invest our clients\u2019 assets occurs at multiple levels within BlackRock.

"as the engine of choice for those who value their privacy.\nIn fact, blocking trackers is DuckDuckGo's main selling point. It is the overriding reason that those who use the tiny search engine don't simply go somewhere else.\nThat's why when Jack Edwards discovered that DuckDuckGo did not stop data flows to Microsoft's Linkedin domains or their Bing advertising domains, the company received fierce backlash from their user base, who felt betrayed.\nThe reason that DuckDuckGo was in the habit of letting Microsoft trackers through lies in the fact that they're in an advertising partnership with the much larger company. To block all their trackers would be to cut off their own revenue streams and the company makes a big chunk of its revenue via Microsoft Advertising.\nThe backlash against the discovery, posted and widely shared on Twitter, prompted CEO Gabriel Weinberg to issue a statement.\nWeinberg's statement reads:\n\"Recently, I've heard from a number of users and understand that we didn't meet their expectations around one of our browser's web tracking protections. So today we are announcing more privacy and transparency around DuckjDuckGo's web tracking protections.\"\nThe new policy can be summed up as follows: DuckDuckGo will now block most of Microsoft's trackers for most of the time. They are making exceptions for trackers used by Microsoft Advertising, because without that, the company would be down a vital revenue stream.\nSignificantly, this means that all third-party trackers affiliated with Microsoft are now blocked, and while it's not a perfect solution, it should be enough to mollify the engine's user base.\nLast Microsoft Edge Update for 2022\nGoogle Leaving IoT Services\nNew Phishing Service Is Targeting Banks\nPhishing-as-a-Service on the Rise with Caffeine\nWindows 11 2022 Update\nFill out the form below to get a free consultation and find out how we can make your technology hassle-free!\n10255 Commerce Dr, Suite 156\nsales@fetzerhaus.com\nFetzerhaus Technology, Inc. $$$\n"

A winning combo on paper. After all, a lot of French voters supported Le Pen's party. But the French president would have consigned himself, in the eyes of the world, to obloquy.

The dominant culture was a blend of Scots-Irish Appalachia and the gentry of the south, with a significant, but unmentioned link to Native American influences.\nIn the past, its proximity to Indian Territory attracted some less desirable residents. If there was likely to be a repercussion after a bank robbery or murder, it was a short distance to \u201cThe Territory\u201d and freedom. There was a sprinkling of other immigrants \u2013 French, German, Slavic origins, but not enough to make much difference. Until very recently it was almost 100% WASP. For nearly 100 years, there were no blacks. There was a county ordinance that no black could be in the county after sundown. It was enforced into the 1960\u2019s. The steep, rocky hills were never an area that favored the formation of plantations. In 1860 there were 50 slaves listed in the census; after the War, blacks were not welcome. I knew only WASP\u2019s until I went to college. As a freshman, I politely told a Catholic girl that she had a smudge on her forehead. It was Palm Sunday. She set me straight and I was embarrassed.\nIsolated from the rest of the world until the First World War, residents relied on kinship and friendship to survive. Strangers, known as \u201cfurriners\u201d were viewed with great skepticism. Who knew what kind of new-fangled ideas they might have and upset the balance of the well known way of life. Oh, there were differences.In the 1860 Presidential election only three of the four candidates were on the ballot. Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln from Illinois favored the North and John Bell from Tennessee the South. John C. Breckenridge of Kentucky wasn\u2019t on the ballot, even though he carried the South, winning 11 states. Lincoln won 18 Northern states and the election even though the difference between the number of votes cast for him and Douglas was less than 5"

A novel, in which all is created by the author's whim, must strike a more profound level of truth, or it is worthless.\"\n\"And yet, I have heard you say that any novel that relieves your ennui for an hour has proved its usefulness.\"\n\"You have a good memory. It must have been ten thousands of years ago that I uttered those words.\"\n\"And if it was?\"\n\"In another ten thousand, perhaps I will agree with them again.\"\n\"In my opinion, the proper way to judge a novel is this: Does it give one an accurate reflection of the moods and characteristics of a particular group of people in a particular place at a particular time? If so, it has value. Otherwise, it has none.\"\n\"You do not find this rather narrow?\"\n\"Madam - \"\n\"Well?\"\n\"I was quoting you. #Quote by Steven Brust\nLiterary Criticism Novels Stories\n#66. Literary Fiction and Reality\nTowards the beginning of his novel The Man Without Qualities, Robert Musil announces that 'no serious attempt will be made to... enter into competition with reality.' And yet it is an element in the situation he cannot ignore. How good it would be, he suggests, if one could find in life ' the simplicity inherent in narrative order. 'This is the simple order that consists in being able to say: \"When that had happened, then this happened.\" What puts our mind at rest is the simple sequence, the overwhelming variegation of life now represented in, as a mathematician would say, a unidimensional order.' We like the illusions of this sequence, its acceptable appearance of causality: 'it has the look of necessity.' But the look is illusory; Musil's hero Ulrich has 'lost this elementary narrative element' and so has Musil. The Man Without Qualities is multidimensional, fragmentary, without the possibility of a narrative end. Why could he not have his narrative order? Because 'every"

What an amazing way to break into the big leagues after an unpromising eight-year journey; what an important moment for father and son.\nMy dad played catch with my brother almost every single day at lunchtime in a bygone era when kids walked home from school for their midday meal, then returned to their classrooms an hour later. Kind of like Jem and Scout and Atticus Finch. Like Atticus with his children, my dad made it his business to join my brother for a sit-down lunch in our small kitchen, and that quick lunch was usually followed by an unhurried game of catch in the front yard.\nThe only boy in our family following three sisters, my brother went on to become an outstanding player in our town's youth league. One spring weekend I rode a Greyhound bus home from college just to see him pitch. Working efficiently and striking out almost every batter in the lineup, my kid brother threw a complete game that Saturday afternoon. Mowed them all down with blazing fastballs and pinpoint control. He was just nine or ten years old at the time, but something about his consistency"

Now, tell me, Mr Daim. Who are you?\u201d\nThe Jinni\nLong before the advent of humankind, the Earth was ruled by jinn, beings made of smokeless flame. Like their younger siblings, the jinn were a divided people, separated into many nations from the Titanian Empire to the Republic of Atlantis. However, none could surpass the might of Mount Qaf, the city of shining emerald, the conduit between the terrestrial and celestial.\nIt was here, at Mount Qaf, that a jinni, whose birth name has been long forgotten even to himself, was born. Unfortunately for the jinni, he came into existence during turbulent times. The Creator had conferred stewardship of the Earth to a new people: the Beni Adam. As you can imagine, this sent shockwaves across the world. If the Beni Adam were to rule, then what would become of the jinn?\nMany jinn saw this as a new beginning and decided to live amongst their counterparts of flesh and blood. Others were fearful of the Beni Adam\u2019s bestial nature and retreated into their own realm. Some jinn, those of the more disobedient kind, saw it as an opportunity and began to take on the Beni Adam as worshippers, building large monuments to false gods. However, the most pre-eminent amongst the jinn, one who had come closest to the Throne of the Creator, refused to accept the sovereignty of the Beni Adam and was subsequently cast out of Heaven. As revenge, he vowed to spend eternity tempting the Beni Adam to do evil.\nAnd so, the jinni, born at Mount Qaf during turbulent times, watched humanity emerge from caves to"

Like the somm is going to make you look like you don\u2019t know anything.

I\u2019m not there to overwhelm you and make you feel comfortable.\nIs a sommelier strictly knowledgeable in wine?\nNo, you need other alcohol-related knowledge. You have to know about spirits, you have to know about cocktails, you have to know about sake, you have to know about coffees and teas, and, back in the day, cigars. You have to know how they distill liquor, how beer is made. Lot of different things. Wine is at the heart of it, but you have to be able to expand to other beverages too.\nAdvice for up and coming sommeliers?\nJust get started.

Fatigue, injury, and stress of health workers is tied to higher risk of patient infections and medication error. The recent influx of mental health and substance abuse patients entering the ER and trauma units due to budget cuts puts the 18 million U.S. healthcare workers, 80% of whom are women, at higher risk for violence.

"in India.\nThe Folland Fo.144 Gnat T.1 is probably most famous however, as being the aircraft of choice for the world-famous RAF Display Team, The Red Arrows.\nFolland Gnat in service with the RAF Red Arrows\nRAF pilots graduated from basic training on the Hunting Percival - BAC Jet Provost and once they had gained their wings they were selected for one of three streams: fast jet, multi-engine aircraft or rotary (helicopters). Those selected for fast jets were posted to RAF Valley on Anglesey where they experienced advanced training on the Folland Gnat T.1.

In: East Afr Med J. 1994 Oct;71(10):651-5. Kisipan, M.L.; 1994. Abstract\nThe efficacy of bloodmeal digestion in teneral Glossina morsitans centralis fed on rabbits immunized with tsetse fly midgut extracts was progressively monitored over a period of 96 hours. Flies fed on immunized rabbits showed reduced rate of bloodmeal digestion as compared to the controls. Although there was insignificant difference in the rate of bloodmeal digestion upto 24 hours post-feeding in later stages of digestion there was quite a significant difference. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic patterns of bloodmeal drawn from the posterior sections of the midgut demonstrated that, bloodmeal is completely degraded in the midgut after 96 hours in the control flies, while substantial amount is still undigested in the experimental flies. However, not much difference in the rates of digestion was observed with bloodmeal drawn from the anterior section of the midgut. These results suggests that when flies are fed on rabbits immunized with tsetse fly midgut extract, there is an impairment on the efficiency of digestion. The anti-midgut antibod"

Firstly, it may be of French locational origin form any of the places in Normandy, for example, Luce (Orne), so called from the Latin personal name Lucius, a derivative of \"lux\", light, plus the locational suffix \"acum\", a settlement. The surname from this source was first recorded in the mid 12th Century, (see below).

", and survives only in various partial transcripts. In 1996, N. W.

These records include:\nBroome, Florentine Frend, allowed 1638 Queen's Company.\nLove Sick Courtier, alld for Salisbury Court, 1638\n(Cited from Bawcutt, Control and Censorship, 202)\nEndymion 1663\nEndymion 1663 is a satirical mock-almanac which includes, in its later pages, a catalogue of all printed plays. In that list occurs, under \"L\":\nLove-sick Courtier, or the Ambitious Politick. c.

This suggestion has been accepted by Brome scholars including Matthew Steggle (122), and Eleanor Lowe in her 2010 edition of The Love-Sick Court.\nAs Joshua McEvilla points out to me, the Endymion 1663 record, not hitherto noted in this connection, makes the same error posited in the Burn transcript. The subtitle indicates that the list is attempting to refer to the printed Brome play. However, it mangles the title, wrongly supposing it to refer to a supposed eponymous character, not (as is in fact the case) to the whole Thessalian court. This parallel error further discourages any lingering thought that the Burn transcript might record an otherwise unknown play.\nThe Florentine Friend is discussed here.\nAnon.,"

"to return to the kingdom of heaven on earth), all false authorities and boundaries must be torn down (deconstructed), and power redistributed from the oppressors to the oppressed; all injustice anywhere is interlinked (intersectional), so the battle against injustice is necessarily total; ultimate victory is cosmically ordained by history, though the arc of progress may be long; moral virtue and true right to rule is determined by collective status within the oppression-oppressed dialectic; morally neutral political liberalism is a lie constructed by the powerful to maintain status quo structures of oppression; the first step to liberation can be achieved through acquisition of the hidden knowledge of the truth of this dialectic; a select awoken vanguard must therefore guide a revolution in popular consciousness; all imposed limits on the individual can ultimately be transcended by virtue of a will to power.\nThe advent of a new religion, especially one as aggressive and evangelical as this, has not only political consequences, but legal ones too.

Free thought and free speech, the woke avow, are mere covers for the worst of ethical sins. If they continue to avoid the religious label, it is for the fundamental reason that the Constitution is incapable of stopping their conquest of public life and law so long as they remain officially an non- religious movement. Having long sought to drive religious ideas and persons from the public square, the woke understand that if the label gains purchase, they might be driven out as well.\nThanks to the vast legal and bureaucratic infrastructure that arose to enforce the revision of the social contract effected by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, wokeness is embedded in all our public institutions.

RXR\u03b3-/- and control WT mice were raised on mixed C57BL6N and 129SVpas genetic background as described [13]. Food (standard chow diet, D04 from SAFE, France) and water were freely available.

We have got to find a way to rebound the ball better.\u201d\nThe Hoyas\u2019 20 offensive rebounds were the real difference. Syracuse has never been a strong defensive rebounding team \u2013 2007-08 they were average among D-I teams \u2013 but this season\u2019s abysmal. Only seven D-I teams are worse.

"19,\u201d Khaldi said. \u201cEven with a vaccine, there will be people who will get sick and need medicine.\u201d\nNuritas is using its AI platform to search for peptides active against COVID-19 targets. They will have two projects focusing on COVID-19 peptide identification: one for identifying antiviral peptides that target how SARS-CoV-2 hijacks cells, and one for identifying peptides that locally reduce lung inflammation without suppressing the entire immune system.\nFor the first project, Nuritas researchers will be searching through a database of peptide drugs that have already been tested in clinical trials. By repurposing peptides that have already been studied in the clinic, they can rapidly move any SARS-CoV-2-active peptides into clinical studies for COVID-19.\nSARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses[9], infects human cells[10] by using the ACE2 receptor (and a few other enzymes, like proteases), then hijacks the cells to churn out more copies of the virus. The first project aims to identify peptides that block the virus at any point, from initial entry into the cell through the viral replication process. Scientists can identify peptides that bind to known targets and simultaneously identify new COVID-19 targets that can be modulated by peptides.\n\u201cIn general, viruses hijack cells via protein-protein interaction,\u201d Khaldi explained. \u201cHow do we stop that interaction and, ultimately, the virus from hijacking the cell? The best way is by using a peptide.\u201d\nIt will take 4-5 months to find peptide hits using the AI platform. Once promising peptides are found, they will be made or obtained from the company who originally made the peptide and passed along to collaborators who can test the peptides on COVID samples and tissues.\nThe second project is longer-term and aims to address the lung issues that coronavirus patients face while acutely sick and after recovering. A 15-year follow-up study on 78 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients in China showed that lung fibrosis was"

They get a small fine and it doesn\u2019t stop them from doing it again.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard enough as a farmer to make a living without it.

"ed, bassist Gerald Cannon, and drummer Willie Jones III. with two special guests, trombonist Elliot Mason on three tracks; and trumpeter Wynton Marsalis offers his unique talents. The album presents ten tracks and the band brings all of their collective heart and soul to the proceedings to clearly present the leader\u2019s intent and ownership of the art their synergy is creating.\nThe repertoire is captivating and expressive, providing brilliant canvases for the musical portraits: deeply grooved blues, poignant ballads, a blistering romp, a refreshing take on an old standard, a Stevie Wonder tune and an intricately crafted exploratory soundscape. Irby composed five of the pieces and shares the solo spotlight generously, but his alto is the primary color that unifies the tracks individually and the overall context that binds them together.\nOur favorite track is \u201cRacine.\u201d The opener on the album starts with a beautiful rubato bass melody that brings us into the right frame of mind for the hard swinging and creative melody to come. The Cannonball influence is front and center on this Irby\u2019s original that is edgy and deeply grooving. With adventurousness and angular melodic lines that are flawlessly performed by Irby and Gardner, the band presents the melody. Once the solos start, that is when the real magic happens, deep deep swing with Irby digging in and unfolding melodic lines that are the next evolution of Cannanballisms, excellent. Gardner\u2019s solo is melodic and develops themes nicely through the changes as he tells his story. Reed is just a joy to listen to, swinging rhythms, smooth chordal passages, colorful melodic single lines and style with just the right amount of attitude behind it. All of this just feels right!\nIrby\u2019s brilliant collection of tunes on Cerulean Canvas has all the essence of the history of jazz presented in the atmosphere of today\u2019s jazz language.

"color and light. From there, I proceed as many oil painters do by washing the canvas with a thin mixture of warm color diluted with mineral spirits. Next I begin to lay in the large shapes. Essentially I am carrying on a dialogue with the canvas, finding out what is working and what is not.\nWhy have you chosen oil painting over other mediums?\nI think the medium choose me. It somehow fits my personality. Oil painting is slow moving and deliberate. It often will take a few days to allow the painting to dry before moving on to the next step. During these intervals the painting is percolating in my brain, trying to make the painting as good as it possibly can be. I compare it to a child with a wind up toy, winding that toy as tight as possible in order to release it to its maximum effect.\nWhat is the biggest difficulty you encounter in the creation of a painting?\nAfter working with a painting for a couple weeks, you can lose the sense of it, you lose perspective. You can begin to doubt yourself: did I make all the right decisions, is the color just right, did I overwork it, does it still capture what you set out to do? At this time, for me, it is important to have honest feedback from others. My wife is an important part in keeping me on track.\n\u2018Hydrangeas in a Bucket\u2019 by Al Candia\nAfter all that work and effort, it must be difficult to let a painting go.\nNot at all.

"1-year deal\nThe Rays have signed outfielder Avisail Garcia to a one-year, $3.5 million deal, according to Jon Heyman of Fancred.\nAvisail: 3.5M guarantee. 2.5M incentives. Pending physical. #rays @Feinsand had the guarantee\n\u2014 Jon Heyman (@JonHeyman) January 14, 2019\nAs Heyman points out, Mark Feinsand of MLB.com first reported the $3.5 million that Garcia will automatically get in the deal. Garcia can earn up to $6 million this year if he reaches all his contract incentives.\nIn addition, Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic first reported that the two sides were close on a deal.\nGarcia had a tough time in 2018 following a breakout All-Star campaign in which he slashed .330/.380/.506 with 18 home runs and 80 RBI in 561 plate appearances. The 27-year-old right-handed hitter played only 93 games, slashing 236/.281/.438 with 19 homers and 49 RBI. However, he missed a lot of time due to hamstring and knee issues.\nThe Rays are taking a chance on Garcia, a .271 career hitter in seven seasons in the majors, in hopes he can give them some pop off the bench with his bat since he is also a below-average outfielder defensively. Currently, the Rays have a quality defensive outfield group in Tommy Pham, Kevin Kiermaier and Austin Meadows, but Garcia gives them depth they could use in case Pham (groin and finger injuries), Kiermaier (thumb injury, fractured hip, broken hand) or Meadows (hamstring and oblique injuries) get hurt again.<s> Home >Blog >SEO Myths to Dump in 2015 (Part 2)\nSEO Myths to Dump in 2015 (Part 2)\nPhillip Reinhardt 5 January 2015\n1St Edition Writ"

More confidence, with better techniques and ripping around a resort they now know like the back of their hands, the #BCNZ Basecamp crew is ready for anything!\nWeek Summary\nIt\u2019s been a windy week in New Zealand with some clouds but also awesome sunny clear days. Ruapehu is a lone mountain with miles clear on each side. This leads to breathtaking views\u2026but it can get a little blowy! The visibility has been incredible, with the mountains in the distance and sea visible on the horizon, and the group has been taking full advantage of the prime weather and extra lessons!\nThe snowboarders have been having an great time as instructor Matty has been taking them off piste and through the park on almost every run. Amelia had never done jumps before, but now she\u2019s hitting them confidently and slowly working up towards consistent 180s. Elliot on the other hand, trickster-on-skis, has gone from no jumps to big air and 180s/shiftys/tweaks and almost anything else, both on the jumps and little bumps off the side of the runs. Not often do you have this much fun while learning and at a classroom you can\u2019t wait to get to in the morning! The skiers have been hard at work on the slopes drilling their carving turns and slowly working on their off piste prepping for the exam which creeps ever closer!\nBirthday bonanzas in #BCNZ!

"Soderbergh has his own way. The way the story unfolds may feel like Tarantino, even opening with a diner scene and featuring a strong and vengeful leading lady, but the dialogue is very akin to a typical Soderbergh film. The dialogue is minimalistic and we are dropped right into the story, so that much of the simple story is only understood after half of the film and many flashbacks.\nThere are many familiar elements to this small spy thriller, but the one that stands out as something new is leading lady Gina Carano. Aside from a few small roles in some fighting films, Carano is best known as a Mixed Martial Arts fighter, as well as one of the American Gladiators. Carano's physical abilities are showcased as she performs her own stunts and fight choreography. Haywire has Carano playing Mallory, a female spy playing in a man's world. In this world many of the men who are supposed to be on her side take sucker punches in order to try and take her out, but this is also the kind of film which predominately features leading men (Channing Tatum, Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender) being beaten senseless by this new action star. She's Jason Bourne, James Bond, Tony Jaa, and a little bit of Rachel Weisz all wrapped into one package.\nGina Carano as Mallory\nThey are calling this film Soderbergh's B-film, and in some ways I can understand what they mean. This is the kind of film which would have been the B-film in a traditional movie-house line-up. It would have been in the same category as the gangster and film noir pictures, lower budget and lower expectations than the main feature. These weren't the award-winning films, and Haywire won't get Soderbergh the same attention that his other films have. This is a 93-minute espionage action film with a lot more hand-to-hand fights than dialogue, but it is still hard for me to consider this a B-film. On top of star names like Fassbender, McGregor and Tatum in the leading men roles, Haywire also features Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas and Bill Pa"

"ough by finding a small whole chicken and cut it up yourself. The secret preparation process requires that you marinate (brine) your chicken for a couple hours in a salt and MSG solution. This will make the chicken moist all of the way through and give it great flavor. After the chicken has brined, it's brushed with liquid smoke-flavored oil that will not only make the seasoning stick to the chicken, but will also ensure that the chicken doesn't stick to the pan. The liquid smoke in the oil gives the chicken a smoky flavor as if it had been cooked on an open flame barbecue grill.\nThe grilled chicken at KFC is probably cooked on ribbed metal plates in specially designed convection ovens to get those grill marks. I duplicated that process using an oven-safe grill pan, searing the chicken first on the stovetop to add the grill marks, then cooking the chicken through in the oven. If you don't have a grill pan or a grill plate, you can just sear the chicken in any large oven safe saute pan. If you have a convection function on your oven you should definitely use it, but the recipe will still work in a standard oven with the temperature set just a little bit higher. After baking the chicken for 20 minutes on each side, you're ready to dive into your own 8-piece bucket of delicious indoor grilled chicken that's as tasty as the fried stuff, but without all the fat.\nCheck out the video demonstration of this recipe.\nSource: \"Top Secret Recipes Step-by-Step\" by Todd Wilbur\nChili's Cajun Ribeye Steak\nMenu Description: \"12 oz. ribeye steak seasoned with Cajun spices and topped with roasted herb jus and spicy Cajun butter.\"\nThree secret formulas must be hacked before we can consider this dish a complete culinary carbon copy of Chili's signature Cajun Ribeye.

"980s by Thomson-CSF and Daimler-Chrysler Aerospac. The HPD2 (or MI AC HPD F2 in French service) was introduced in 1988. The mines use a 3.3kg charge made up of an RDX/TNT mix to create an explosively formed penetrator using the Misznay\u2013Schardin effect. The mines are said to be able to penetrate armour between 100 to 150mm thick. The mines have a 10 minute arming delay once set and can be active for up to 30 day before they deactivate themselves. Because the mine can be triggered by the electromagnetic field of a metal detector it has been said that this contravenes the Geneva Convention\u2019s Protocol II (May 3, 1996).\nThe HPD-2 is made up of two sections: a fuze assembly with a magnetic influence sensor and a two battery power supply, the self-neutralising system and the arming mechanism and the mine\u2019s explosive charge. It reportedly has an anti-handling device sensitive to motion and the signals produced by metal detectors. The mine is detonated when the seismic sensor reacts to vibrations made by passing vehicles and a magnetic sensor is activated. The magnetic sensor uses variation in the earth\u2019s magnetic field caused by the proximity of a vehicle\u2019s large metal mass. Sources suggest the magnetic sensors is triggered by vehicles over 8 tons.\nWhile there has been no official confirmation the mines are believed to have been provided by France as part of their military aid to Ukraine which has also included VAB armoured vehicles, Mistral short range air defence systems and anti-tank guided missile systems including MILAN and Javelin.\nWe\u2019ve previously examined the German DM22, Estonian PK-14 and Russian PTKM-1R mines in use in Ukraine.\nSupport Us: If you enjoyed this video and article please consider supporting our work here.

Brooks School of Public Policy\nStates that permit recreational use of cannabis see a reduction in demand for prescription codeine, an opioid with a high potential for misuse.\nPublished Jan. 19 in Health Economics, a new study finds a significant reduction in pharmacy-based codeine distribution in states that have legalized recreational cannabis use. The finding is promising from a public health policy perspective because misuse of prescription opioids annually contributes to more than 10,000 overdose deaths.\nTwenty-one U.S. states have passed recreational cannabis laws and legislatures in other states are considering similar measures.\n\u201cA reduction in the misuse of opioids will save lives,\u201d said doctoral candidate Shyam Raman who is affiliated with the Cornell Jeb E.

Despite the fact that the company is affiliated with the Heineken Foundation in the Netherlands and has external shareholders it has, however, ensured over the years to have Sierra Leoneans in its employ as long as they possess the requisite qualifications and skills instead of largely importing foreign expatriates.\nEven where foreign expatriates are employed it is the company\u2019s policy to have Sierra Leoneans who should understudy them and after a period of time the nationals takes over their positions.\nTo further deepen its rolling out of the Local Content Policy, SLBL is making use of sorghum, which are locally cultivated, in the brewing of some of its beverages. This has encouraged certain farmers to grow sorghum where it is very ideal to do so and at present the number of sorghum farmers and family has increased exponentially standing over 25,000 in various districts.\nSLBL has been steadily supporting these farmers in diverse ways to increase their yields in order to match up with their demand. What this has led to is a symbiotic relationship between SLBL and the sorghum farmers.

"s Midas list of \"the people who most successfully use venture capital to create wealth for their investors.\" He's been the subject of two admiring profiles in the Washington Post (one reprinted from Slate) in the past two days for his latest venture: ethanol. If Vinod Khosla says ethanol is a good investment, don't bet against him. Or against fellow Silicon Valley megamillionaire Bill Gross, who says that \"reinventing energy . . . dwarfs any business opportunity in history.\" But if it's such a good investment, why is Khosla \"supporting an initiative on this fall's ballot in California that would tax oil companies to generate $4 billion to help encourage the use of alternative energy,\" as Slate writer Daniel Gross notes? Khosla told Post columnist Sebastian Mallaby that he wants just a little help from the federal government, too: \"Khosla wants government to require auto companies to make more flex-fuel cars that run on gasoline or ethanol. . . . Khosla wants government to require big gasoline distributors to install ethanol pumps at a tenth of their gas stations.\" Oh, and a better subsidy. Taxing your competitors to subsidize your industry is a rent-seeker's dream. Usually you have to be more subtle about it. But if you have a \"green\" business idea, you can get liberal journalists to write gushing stories about you without even stopping to ask, \"Hey, aren't you going to benefit from these initiatives and laws you're pushing? Isn't that sort of like, you know, corporate welfare? Like we're always accusing the oil industry of?\" We shouldn't bet against Khosla. But if his latest investment is really such a great business opportunity, we should feel free to vote against subsidizing it.\nThe DLC Moves Left?

The close-up shot of Harold Abrahams is taken from earlier in the film when Harold was reacting to his own defeat by Eric.

"re simply not biting.\nEffective jigging techniques for targeting trout through the ice\nWhen fishing closest to the weed line, make sure your presentation is hugging the bottom, typically 8- to 12-inches from the lake floor. Drop to the bottom, then a couple cranks up and you\u2019re in the strike zone.\nThere\u2019s no jigging cadence that\u2019s tried and true. Really, it\u2019s whatever you feel comfortable with. One thing that is for certain, however, is that your jigging cadence needs to be consistent and in rhythm. If you\u2019re erratic, the trout will have a tough time attacking your presentation \u2014 and we\u2019re in the business of making it easier for trout to bite your lure, not harder.\nThe only exception to rhythmic jigging is, occasionally, dropping your presentation to the bottom to drum up some silt and create a disturbance. Trout, in shallower water, are constantly feeding on prey that burrow in the sand, thus anything out of the ordinary is sure to catch their eye, especially from further distances. Alternatively, on really slow days, you can try dead sticking, just a few inches off the bottom, meaning you\u2019re doing nothing with your presentation (tipped with a worm or bait) except holding it still.\nLater in the day, when the trout move deeper, you\u2019re going to follow them, as you\u2019ve already pre-drilled holes in this deeper water. Fish to these suspended trout, at least six feet from the top of the water column, using the same, rhythmic jigging cadence as before.\nLastly, big, gnarly chums like big, gnarly p lugs. A MagLip 5.0, or a K15-Kwikfish in bright colors either being back bounced or just simply plunked will catch chums. You can elect to wrap the plugs or just use some Pro-Cure Super Gel in herring, anchovy, or garlic, as it will stick to the plugs very well. Back bouncing them down a deep hole is a log of fun and a great way to catch fish. If there is enough current, then pulling them in a traditional way also works well. It"

They never come off the field. It\u2019s going to be a great challenge for us.\u201d\nTHE FINAL WORD:\nThese are two teams that are relatively evenly matched, but Washington will have the advantages of playing at home, having three weeks to prepare for the same opponent, and being healthier. On the flip side, coming off a bye week can lead to rusty play. The Commanders get Chase Young back, but the Giants will also hopefully have Leonard Williams for a full game this time around. The addition of Darnay Holmes could be significant too. I would also not underestimate the rustiness of Gates, nor the injuries that Feliciano and Glowinski played with in the last game.\nI\u2019ll finish with what I said earlier. Jones and Barkley need to make plays in key situations. Turnovers and tackling are also huge.\nGame Review: Philadelphia Eagles 48 \u2013 New York Giants 22\nJones added 26 yards and a touchdown on the ground. Brian Daboll pulled him in the fourth quarter as the game simply got out of reach and he was taking so many hits. Jones saw the typical and expected amount of pressure and he was working against the typical number of mismatches all afternoon. He did not turn the ball over. He had an impressive string of passes in the second half. He made plays with his legs that most quarterbacks in the league did not. All of these were positives in a situation where everything about this matchup was simply lopsided in PHI\u2019s favor.\nThe deeper part of my assessment is not as friendly. Jones had multiple opportunities to show progress in the area where he has come up short on multiple occasions. He did not come through. Besides the quick-fire, one-read throws, Jones struggled to work his eyes and hips to the open target. On 3rd-and-10 from midfield in"

"when we get to it.\"\nIn the last ten years, about 1100 new California bridges and overpasses have been built such as this new Napa River Bridge 13 months ago. Almost 600 have undergone major reconstruction. Nonetheless, the state has identified needed repairs on 4100 more structures at a cost of $13 billion.\nIn his State of the State address 13 months ago, Governor Jerry Brown proposed increasing car registration fees and gas taxes, to pay for an estimated $77 Billion in needed repairs to not just our bridges, but our ravaged roadways as well.\n\"We need to bite the bullet and enact new fees and new taxes for this purpose,\" said California Governor Jerry Brown.

Nationally, 56,000 structurally deficient bridges are crossed by 200 million cars, trucks and buses.\nTo put that in a more understandable light, if put end to end, those 56,000 deficient bridges would stretch all the way from San Francisco, half way to New York City, almost 2700 miles away.\n\"As the old saying goes: anybody who says you can't fix a problem by throwing money at it, is talking about somebody else's problem,\" says Congressman Mike Thompson, (D) Napa.\nThis is a problem for all of us and we need to throw tons of money at it.

"Method is only an allowable for Covered Entities to use to avoid calculating actual or average allowable costs when a Covered Entity is providing electronic copies of PHI maintained electronically (and presumably when the access request is not fulfilled through download from an EHR). When applicable, the Flat Fee Method allows a Covered Entity to charge a flat fee for all requests for electronic copies of PHI maintained electronically, provided the fee does not exceed $6.50, inclusive of all labor, supplies, and any applicable postage. The New Clarification \u2013 Up to $6.50 Flat Rate Option clarifies that use of the Flat Rate Method is permitted not required when a Covered Entity provides copies of PHI maintained electronically other through download directly from a certified EHR. Covered Entities that wish to charge more than the $6.50 flat rate allowed under the Flat Rate Option retain the right, if the facts and evidence warrant, to use either the Actual Cost Method or Average Cost Method to calculate the fee for providing electronic records electronically within the boundaries of what is permissible under the Privacy Rule.\nWhere the Flat Fee Method is inapplicable or the Covered Entity elects not to use it, the Covered Entity must use either the Actual Cost Method or the Average Cost Method to calculate the fee in accordance with OCR\u2019s rules.\nUnder the \u201cActual Cost Method,\u201d a Covered Entity may calculate actual labor costs to fulfill the request, as long as the labor included is only for copying (and/or creating a summary or explanation if the individual chooses to receive a summary or explanation) and the labor rates used are reasonable for such activity. The Covered Entity may add to the actual labor costs any applicable supply (e.g., paper, or CD or USB drive) or postage costs. Covered Entities that charge individuals actual costs based on each individual access request still must be prepared to inform individuals in advance of the approximate fee that may be charged for providing the individual with a copy of her PHI. An example of an actual labor cost calculation would be to time how long it takes for the workforce member of the Covered Entity (or business associate) to make and send the copy in the form and format and manner requested or agreed to by the individual and multiply the time by the reasonable hourly rate of the person copying and sending"
"update the values of alpha and be, so we don\u2019t have to update the value of beta. Again, we don\u2019t prune because the condition remains the same. Similarly, the third child node also. And then backtracking to the root we set alpha=3 because that is the minimum value that alpha can have.\nNow, alpha=3 and beta=infinity at the root. So, we don\u2019t prune. Carrying this to the center node, and calculating MIN{2, infinity}, we get alpha=3 and beta=2.\nPrune the second and third child nodes because alpha is now greater than beta.\nAlpha at the root remains 3 because it is greater than 2. Carrying this to the rightmost child node, evaluate MIN{infinity,2}=2. Update beta to 2 and alpha remains 3.\nHence, we get 3, 2, 2 at the left, center, and right MIN nodes, respectively. And calculating MAX{3,2,2}, we get 3. Therefore, without even looking at four leaves we could correctly find the minimax decision.\nPseudocode (Source: NPTEL Course):\nevaluate (node, alpha, beta)\nif node is a leaf\nreturn the utility value of node\nif node is a minimizing node\nbeta = min (beta, evaluate (child, alpha, beta))\nif beta <= alpha\nreturn beta\nif node is a maximizing node\nalpha = max (alpha, evaluate (child, alpha, beta))\nreturn alpha\nGames are very appealing and writing game-playing programs is perhaps even more exciting. What Grand Prix racing is to the car industry, game playing is to AI.\nJust as we would not expect a racing car to run perfectly on a bumpy road, we should not expect game playing algorithms to be perfect for every situation.\nSo is the minimax algorithm.

"pitch. First and foremost, he just needs to stay healthy and pitch in order to sort out whether his future is in the rotation or as a Jose Alvarado-type high-octane reliever who walks a few.\n7. 3B/2B Cade Doughty\nYEAR IN REVIEW: The third of three second-round picks the Jays held last July thanks to Marcus Semien and Robbie Ray walking in free agency, Doughty split time between second base and third base with the Tigers and that\u2019s exactly what the Jays did in his pro debut, as well. What the 6-foot-1, 195-pound right-handed hitter did with the bat was noticeable, as he slashed .272/.370/.495 with six homers across 119 trips to the plate.\nOUTLOOK: Opinions are mixed on Doughty\u2019s bat, but the power he showed in his pro debut was exciting and there are those who believe there\u2019s much more to come thanks to the bat-to-ball skills and work ethic. If he continues to show pop, there\u2019s a potential well-rounded, everyday third baseman here.\n6. 3B/SS Addison Barger\nYEAR IN REVIEW: During the first week of spring training coming out of the lockout last March, Kevin Gausman was throwing his first live BP session on a backfield in Dunedin. One of the first hitters he faced turned on a high fastball and launched it over the netting in right field. It was Barger. And it was a sign of things to come. Not able to crack this top 50 list in the four years after being drafted in 2018 out of a Tampa-area high school \u2014 a PED suspension in 2019 followed by the pandemic had Barger missing out on a whole lot of important developmental at-bats \u2014 Barger broke out in a big way in 2022, starting the year in High-A and finishing it in Triple-A thanks to a monster .308/.378/.555 slash line and 26 bombs.

"disabilities, is a set of textured labels which can be attached to the keyboard and ports to make it easier to identify what they are by touch and color.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Surface team has grown from just designing a couple of devices, to a wide swath of devices covering a large part of the PC market, and they have expanded beyond those borders too with the Surface Duo and Surface Duo 2. Looking at the devices holistically, the design team generally tries to offer something with a slight twist compared to the other designs on the market, and some are more successful design wins than others. The Surface Pro, as an example, as created an entire genre of devices that mimic it, and the update being announced today is a solid refresh of that design which should allow Surface Pro to continue to be the industry leader.\nThe Surface Laptop Studio is an interesting design, and while not a completely new concept, it looks to be a well-executed take on the convertible laptop. From the specifications, it appears to be taking over from the Surface Book, which was their previous performance-laptop. It is less complicated than the Surface Book, which should lead to an overall better product.\nThe Surface Pro X certainly did not see very much love, and Windows on Arm did not get advanced at all on the hardware front today. The Surface Pro 8 now gets the same 13-inch display, which is good for the Pro 8, but does diminish the Pro X. Surface Go 3 also got just the tiniest of updates and is still a somewhat awkward device. The base model is inexpensive, but unimpressive, and when the necessary options are chosen, the price creeps up. It is still a well-built device, with a wonderful magnesium allow chassis and individually calibrated display, which sounds great for $400, but the $400 model is significantly more disappointing than the upgraded models sadly.\nMicrosoft tends to update their hardware at almost random intervals, but quibbles aside, these updates are all welcome, with some really excellent changes, such as the addition of Thunderbolt 4. I look forward to being able to try some of these devices out in the future and see how much the changes impact the device experience.\nMicrosoft Resurfaces The Surface Lineup For 20"
"inton. The only issue on which the facts are not complete was whether Trump was a passive beneficiary or he knowingly worked with the Kremlin, whether obliquely or hand-in-glove.\nThe president\u2019s eldest son was told in writing in June 2016 that the Kremlin wanted to help his father become president. Trump Jr. replied enthusiastically \u201clove it\u201d and then met at Trump Tower with Kremlin agents. The son then lied and denied, telling both Fox News and ABC News that no such contact took place. More than a year later, as The New York Times was about to expose these lies, the namesake son released the damning emails.\nEconomic Collapse and Riots\nTrump has openly talked six times about being president for life. When criticized for such assaults on American Constitutional principles, Trump lamely claimed he was joking. He also said last June that he anticipates that after completing the maximum of two terms his supporters will \u201cdemand that I stay longer.\u201d\nTrump campaigned on a promise to destroy our government, an issue that has disappeared from the news after getting almost no attention during his campaign.\n'Country Goes to Total Hell'\nThat promise came after Trump told Fox News in 2014 how to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. \u201cWhen the economy crashes, when the country goes to total hell, and everything is a disaster\u2026 you\u2019ll have riots to go back to where we used to be when we were great,\u201d he said.\nOn Wednesday, as the pandemic death toll surpassed 75,000 Americans he renewed his demand that the law be made history. Repeal would leave at least 20 million Americans with no health insurance.\nJust weeks after assuming office Trump held an unannounced meeting in the Oval Office with Russia\u2019s foreign minister and Russian ambassador and a \u201cphotographer\u201d for the Kremlin-owned Tass news agency.

"exposed, just like us. That was agonizing.\nAdding insult to injury, a sign outside the hospital in big colorful letters, \u201cHeroes work here!\u201d\nBONDED IN TRAUMA\nThe change and backtracking were constant. First we were told, \u201cDon\u2019t wear a mask.\u201d Then, \u201cYou can wear one, but not an N95.\u201d Then, \u201cYou must wear an N95, but you have to reuse it six times.\u201d Then, \u201cWe can clean the N95s with this unproven method. You still need to reuse it six times; we are counting.\u201d\nBut when a nurse\u2019s husband, two nurses, and two support staff from clean units died, there was silence from the administration. Actually, sometimes we still got reminders about being late with medications or charting.\nEvery shift we prayed at the nurses\u2019 station. We had isolation gown-folding parties where anyone with a spare second helped fold, because the linen department couldn\u2019t keep up. We came running when co-workers called, even if it was just for a straw. We all knew what it took to go into a Covid room. Multiple trips are not possible.\nThe unit staff became fused together in a way none of us can ever undo. I guess that\u2019s what a trauma bond is. We coped by ordering matching Covid shirts and buying scrub-cap/mask sets. And we ate, so much. It was all we could do.\nWE ALL GOT SICK\nNurses and techs were the only ones going into rooms. Doctors called their patients on the telephone or iPad. Dietary just dropped off the trays in the hallway. Housekeeping left their mop out for us while we pulled the trash.\nOne by one we all got sick. Some were gone for weeks, some months, some much longer. There was a Covid antibody plasma drive for one nurse who was on a ventilator for weeks. I worried he might die. He didn\u2019t, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the same; none of us are.\nThe ones who got sick were not the only ones to suffer. Everyone did, mostly without a word. The mental work it took"
"boys brought up on Harry Palmer and John Le Carre there was still a bit of a thrill to be had in crossing to the \"other side\".\nThe gig itself was like any other large open air event in Europe that summer, but the crowd were different in subtle ways. The clothes wer thinner and less fashionable, and the mullet was still the haircut of the day. A sea of enthusiastic denim greeted the bands. Fans took it all a bit more seriously in East Germany, treating rock and roll as a privilege and at the same time a subversive form of communication, whilst in the West it had already become another piece of pre packaged consumer entertainment.\nAnd talking about taking things for granted, Big Country turned in another seemingly effortless yet rousing live performance. Classics like In A Big Country and The Storm provided a platform for some of the more eclectic music featured on their forthcoming album Peace In Our Time. The audience hadn't of course been exposed to the same songs, so response was uniformly good but not always predictable. Also on the bill was the worthy and earnest man of the blue collar people Bryan Adams. He took the stage in blue jeans and jacket and was immediately at home with the rock starved fans.\nBackstage a lot of the talk was of the forthcoming visit to Moscow, this was in many ways just a taster of what was to come. Complicated bureaucracy, chill winds and dreadful catering.

"022, Connected Nation has been quietly\u2014and sometimes not so quietly\u2014playing a role in making that possible.\nLooking over the edge\u2026 on the precipice of great change\nThe pandemic created new understanding of the real-world implications of not closing the Digital Divide. This realization led to an unprecedented level of funding for expanding broadband (high-speed internet). Billions of dollars were set aside at the state and federal levels.\nBut, perhaps more importantly, these funds come with specific guidelines that may finally ensure they reach\u2014and even favor\u2014those with the greatest need.\nThe pandemic showed us all how critical having a broadband connection is to accessing improtant resources and opportunities.\nFor example, the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s (FCC) launched the Affordable Connectivity Fund to help low-income families; the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is administering several Digital Equity Act programs that require states to focus on digital inclusion; and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is handling the ReConnect Loan and Grant Program, which is focused on expanding high-speed internet access in rural areas.\nIn addition, with the recent release of the FCC National Broadband Map, emphasis is being placed on awarding grants and larger funding allocations based on the number of unserved areas (those areas with no broadband infrastructure) and underserved areas (those areas with little competition or low speeds) that would be served through a state\u2019s broadband plan.\nThere are also programs offering funding to help expand access, adoption, and use of broadband to tribal areas, minority communities, and for middle-mile projects, which are those projects that extend national and regional internet infrastructure into remote communities.\nWe are now on the verge of great change, but many leaders are looking over the edge with uncertainty, unsure of taking that leap. That\u2019s because broadband can be a complicated subject\u2014one that requires deep knowledge and understanding of not only the technology but also the social issues surrounding the Digital Divide.\nIt\u2019s why Connected Nation, a national nonprofit with more than 20 years\u2019 experience in this space, has spent 2022 providing guidance, support, and understanding for state leaders, local communities, and even"
"critical of the current government and ruling party leader Bidzina Ivanishvili.\nThe opposition believes the corruption trial against Nika Gvaramia is politically motivated.\nThe leaders of various opposition groups have voiced their support for Gvaramia and accuse the authorities of political persecution.\nThe prosecutor\u2019s office accuses Gvaramia of diverting millions from TV company Rustavi 2 to an advertising firm owned by his friends (see the press release in Georgian). If convicted, the former TV director faces several years in prison.\nGvaramia categorically denies the accusations and calls them nonsense.\nHe served as a member of parliament, minister of justice and minister of education and science under the presidency of Mikheil Saakashvili.

In a similar way as in Sorting Signed Permutations by SSOs, the authors proved that, given any VD-vector X for \\(\\pi\\) such that X has the minimum crossing number over all VD-vectors for \\(\\pi\\), the sorting distance of \\(\\pi\\) is precisely \\(cn(X) + k\\), where k is the number of elements in \\(\\{neven(X,\\pi ) \\cup podd(X,\\pi )\\}\\).

It was so freakin perfect. Oh Stephen King, I love you. You should be required reading on all flights. :)\nI didn't tell you guys this, but a reporter from the New York Times called to interview me the other day!! I don't know if anything I said will end up in the story, but my fingers are tightly crossed that it will.\nAnd finally, Damon Lindelof tweeted yesterday that as of the end of this weekend, he and Carlton are putting the final period at the end of the final script of Lost. This is it... by Monday, the last words will have been written, and the actual writing on the show is done. I read that and was filled with a crazy excitement. Other people were more morose and upset and, \"Oh MAN that depresses me to no end\" but I'm really really excited. This is what we've been waiting for, and why does everyone think the discussion ENDS when Lost does? That's when it BEGINS for me!!\nSo, in the spirit of Darlton finishing Lost this weekend, I'm going to begin writing the last of my Finding Lost books. Sad, yes. As sad as the thought of no more Benjamin Linus on my TV week after week? No.\nOK, SERIOUSLY Nikki, you're already one hour behind on your schedule today and haven't begun.

"7]; and sustained and integrated over extended periods of time [54].\nSOAR spanned six mutually reinforcing elements: teacher training and development; curriculum and classroom materials; student support and development; parent and community involvement; school policies and guidelines; and monitoring and reporting of racial discrimination. Teacher training and development: 2 days of face-to-face training were provided for classroom teachers delivering the SOAR curriculum and classroom materials as well as any other interested school staff. These training workshops were presented by research staff from the Australian National University (NP, MT) together with staff from a service provider working with schools to support students of refugee backgrounds. New South Wales (NSW) Department of Education staff attended the NSW training and development workshops. After the training workshops, coaching sessions were delivered via phone or online throughout the program to enable staff to debrief with the research team and troubleshoot any issues. Curriculum and classroom materials: the SOAR classroom materials constituted an eight-week unit of work that included suggested activities and questions. The framework for this unit of work and classroom materials were developed by the research team (NP, OA), then workshopped and refined prior to implementation with classroom teachers and school support staff who had experience working with children from culturally, racially and religiously diverse communities, and reviewed by education department staff. These activities were facilitated in-class by classroom teachers, and culminated in the development of a class charter on pro-active anti-racist bystander action. Student support and development: the pedagogical approach of the SOAR program had a strong focus on students as experts and engaged learners throughout. This was foundational to the classroom materials and culminated in \u2018Team SOAR\u2019 student-led sessions for the second half of the program. \u2018Team SOAR\u2019 was a team of student influencers selected by teachers and classmates at the end of the eight-week unit of work to continue to promote the principles of SOAR. They held student-led meetings to develop materials and activities for their peers and the wider school community. Parent and community involvement: Team SOAR students developed activities to engage with parents and the wider community, and to communicate SOAR principles more broadly.

So I knew what a kind and peaceful person she is: she just emanates warmth and wisdom, even over a computer screen.\nAnd I did love Braiding Sweetgrass nearly as much as I expected to, with the caveat that the tiny-print 400 pages of my paperback edition make the essays feel very dense. I could only read a handful of pages in a sitting. Also, after about halfway, it started to feel a bit much, like maybe she had given enough examples from her life, Native American legend and botany. The same points about gratitude for the gifts of the Earth, kinship with other creatures, responsibility and reciprocity are made over and over.\nHowever, I feel like this is the spirituality the planet needs now, so I\u2019ll excuse any repetition (and the basket-weaving essay I thought would never end). \u201cIn a world of scarcity, interconnection and mutual aid become critical for survival. So say the lichens.\u201d (She\u2019s funny, too, so you don\u2019t have to worry about the contents getting worthy.)

Lolo Soetoro was one of some 4000 Indonesian army officers who were trained in the United States between 1958 and 1965 and the CIA and Pentagon ensured that these officers would be available for the long-planned overthrow of Sukarno. In fact, an overwhelming majority of Indonesian army officers who were trained abroad received their training in the United States, not in the Soviet Union or China. The air force, on the other hand, was seen as pro-PKI and PKI influence extended into the junior officer ranks of the Indonesian navy, particularly in Surabaya, eastern Java.\nThe Indonesian army also included some PKI sympathizers, especially in units in central and eastern Java, which were also areas of interest to Ann Soetoro in her \"anthropological field work\" for the U.S. government.

"Team Championship at Hard to Kill, so if this is what we can expect from that, it should be a lot of fun. I'm curious if Cardona lost because he's on his way out of IMPACT (and potentially back to WWE) or if I'm reading too much into it.\nBully Ray Attacked Scott D'Amore\nI realize this storyline with Bully hasn't been for everyone, but to give credit where it's due, Bully has played his role really well in showing no remorse and biting back at everyone who has taken exception to his actions. That includes D'Amore, who didn't back down and instead struck Bully first because he had to know it was coming. Bully had help from John Skyler and Jason Hotch in putting D'Amore through the table. This was an effective way of putting more heat on Bully ahead of Hard to Kill and I'm sure Alexander will attempt to avenge D'Amore next week.\nEven with the week off due to the holiday, IMPACT returned with a super solid show this week that was fully focused on hyping up Hard to Kill. The show-closing angle was well done and the matches were well wrestled. However, the best parts of the show were the tribute to the late, great Don West (rest in peace!) and the Mickie James career retrospective (which left me thinking we might actually see James' sendoff at Hard to Kill). The pay-per-view lineup has potential on paper, so here's hoping IMPACT can start the year off strong.\nSEE MORE: IMPACT Reviews<s> The Daily Vogue > Fashion Industry\nFashion Industry Stories\nFashion and beauty are constantly evolving, and staying up-to-date\u2026\nAlice Trout January 19, 2023\nMarketing a healthcare business can be a challenging task.\u2026\nAlice Trout January 3, 2023\nTop Men\u2019s Fashion Houses\nWhoever said that fashionable clothing is just for women\u2026\nHelen S.

"2\nIn reality, we are relying on a PCR test to diagnose SARS-CoV2 infection, the accuracy of which is entirely dependent on believing that the test is accurate. Yes, that is the route to madness.\nAt present, in the UK, we are doing about one million tests a day 3.\nWe are getting about thirty thousand \u2018positive\u2019 results. Or, about 3% positive. How many of these are truly positive? Well, you can take a wild guess on that one. At one point, the CDC stated that 30% of the PCR tests were false positives. A \u2018false positive\u2019 means that test says you have the disease, when you do not. [A false negative informs you that you do not have the disease, when you do] 4.\nThe thirty per cent cannot be the case currently, because that would mean if you did one million tests, you would get more than three hundred thousand false positives. Instead we are getting thirty thousand, which means that it is impossible for the false positive rate to be higher than three per cent.\nSo, what is the true rate? Well, if is three percent, then virtually every single positive test is a false positive test. [Three per cent of one million is thirty thousand] Which would mean that no-one in the UK currently has COVID19, and everything we are doing is completely pointless. It also means that people admitted to hospital with COVID19 do not have the disease, they are suffering from, and dying from, something else with a false positive COVID19 false test stamped on their forehead.\nIs it possible that no-one actually is infected with SARS-CoV2? Well, it is certainly not impossible. Here is a graph of overall mortality (risk of dying of anything) from England. These figures, unlike most others, are pretty much fully reliable. Someone is either dead, or they are not. It is a difficult thing to get wrong, or manipulate. There can be some delay in registering a death, but this is not normally a major issue.\nThe graph starts in last quarter 2017. As you can see, a spike in overall mortality in Spring 2020, A spike in Winter 2020/21. Currently, no excess mortality at all. So, if"

"possible with the system since he was the newcomer and they were willing to sacrifice Lin's game to make Harden more comfortable.\n\"After the 38 point game against the Spurs, Lin started getting more touches again though he's still not the floor general he was last year when he was on the Knicks before Melo came back from injury. Basically, the coaching staff thus far lets Lin \"solidify\" his role only when the franchise player is injured.\"\nThe reason Lin is not handling the ball all the time because Lin and Harden basically have the same skill and can handle the ball. The coaches did not want what happened to Lin with the Knicks last year during the Miami game to happen to Lin this year. They needed more options at ball handling so that if teams decided to zone in on Lin they have a two or three headed monster in Harden and Parsons. It doesn't mean they let him solidify his role. They were still experimenting to see what will work having both Lin and Harden on the floor. So far the medium has been to sub Lin out with 3 - 4 minutes left in the 1st. Rest Harden in the 2nd and have Lin play with Tony. Bring Harden in with 6 minutes left in the 2nd. Have Lin and Harden start the 3rd. Rest Lin during the later half of the 3rd and then finally bringing TD, Harden and Lin in the 4th quarter and finally letting Harden and Lin combo finish up the game.\nJohn Ly, I don't think anyone is saying that the coaches are literally trying to sabotage Lin's career. However, I understand what you are saying and it does appear that the coaches confidence in Lin has been increasing which is great.\nEtane, I agree with your posts. It's frustrating because as a fan, I feel that the team as a whole does so much better when Jeremy is the floor general with the ball in his hands. I wonder if that is because of my own personal bias or whether there are any statistics that support that view. Don't get me wrong, in order for the team to win, Harden should also have his touches and his iso offense is also needed when used correctly. But, Are the coaches relying too much on running the offense through Harden"
"of a culture are those stories it takes seriously - the ones that are thought to be a key to its identity. #Quote by Margaret Atwood\nLegend Myth\n#87. Literature is news which stays news. #Quote by Ezra Pound\nLiterary Criticism Poetry\n#88. t this point I would like to return to the question of the plot movement and the different narrative levels of the book. David Lodge raises a crucial issue when he asks 'how Charlotte Bront\u00eb created a literary structure in which the domestic and the mythical, the realistic world of social behaviour and the romantic world of passionate self-consciousness, could co-exist with only occasional\nlapses into incongruity.' As far as the plot and setting go, however, this states the question rather misleadingly, for in fact at Thornfield there begins a progressive plot movement from realism to fantasy. By 'realism' I do not mean the predominance of the every day and commonplace, or an authorial objectivity of treatment,\nbut simply the use of material that the reader can accept\nas existing in the ordinary world as well, or of events of a kind that might happen in it without being viewed as extraordinary. That is, things that have a face-value currency of meaning prior to any concealed meaning they may hold or suggest. Thus while Gateshead and Lowood School fit neatly into, and contribute importantly to,\nthe symbolic pattern of the book, they are perfectly believable places in their own right. Even the heavy-handed and obvious satire of Mr Brocklehurst and his family does not invalidate him as a credible conception. But with the beginning of the mystery of the Thornfield attic the plot starts moving away from this facevalue\nactuality. #Quote by Ian Gregor\n#89. In his 1923 review of James Joyce Ulysses, T. S. Eliot focused on one of his generation's recurrent anxieties\nthe idea that art might be impossible in the twentieth century. The reasons that art seemed impossible are many and complex, but they were all related to the collapse of ways of knowing that had served the Western mind at least since the Renaissance and that had received canonical formulation in the seventeenth century in the science of Newton and"

Virginia Woolf once described poetry as \u2018a voice answering a voice\u2019 \u2013 poetry is always communal in that it is always a communication, a reaching of one person towards another and back. Poetry communities not only matter, but poetry communities are themselves part of the act of poetry.\nPersonally, I have tended to write quietly and hold my words close to myself. It is only recently I have begun learning to let my words free, and to really acknowledge the part of poetry that is the voice listening and the voice answering back. And it is through poetry communities that this interaction of voice and voice can be facilitated.\nSo I am bursting with appreciation and gratitude for poetry communities. They make space in a busy world for the simple beauty of words, and remind those of us with a penchant for hiding of the reciprocity at the heart of poetry. The way that, in essence, it is all about sharing.\nThe contributors:\nEliana Gray is a poet from \u014ctepoti. They like queer subtext in teen comedies and not much else. They have had words in: SPORT, Mimicry, Minarets, Mayhem and others. Their debut collection, Eager to Break, was published by Girls On Key Press (2019) and they are the 2020 writer in residence at Villa Sarkia, Finland.

"It was both extremely horrifying and also satisfying when I was first able to remove the teensy expensive gold earrings, to see them caked with skin gunk even all my assiduous cleaning hadn\u2019t been able to reach. (Bodies are gross, I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re allowed to do this kind of thing.)\nPeople Actually Live Like This?\nBut the real stuff I didn\u2019t know didn\u2019t come until after that six-month mark, when I finally got to try out different types of earrings. I didn\u2019t realize all the things people (women, mostly) go through all the time with earrings. Like it\u2019s no big deal. Such as:\nThere are things on the back of some earrings, particularly dangly ones, that are meant to keep the earring on. You shouldn\u2019t throw these nameless plastic doohickeys away or you WILL lose an earring somewhere in the office.\nHeavy earrings actually hurt. Sure, they are fun at first, but over time it will feel like your head is dragging down.\nEven non-heavy earrings sometimes make you feel like this. Earrings will be the first thing you take off when you get home; shoes are second.\nDangly earrings will constantly tangle in your hair. This makes them less cute.\nGetting dangly earrings stuck on your jacket/sweater/anything can make them pull. And hurt.\nStuds are fine but the ones with pointy edges will poke you. Stars are awesome but so pokey.\nFlat cellphone faces are the worst for earring wearers. It\u2019s so much harder to talk on the phone when you have to hold it out at an angle to get it close to your ear without hearing the scritch thunk of the earring over whomever you\u2019re speaking to. It\u2019s a huge bother.\nIt\u2019s also a huge bother to take off earrings for a work phone call.\nSometimes, for no discernable reason, an earring will refuse to go into the piercing. Trying harder just makes it madder. You end up with both earrings properly in, but one ear red and slightly swollen.\nIt is possible to spend quite a lot of money"

The severity of UV-induced morphology (e.g., whole-plant size and leaf size reductions, leaf malformations, and stigma browning) and physiology (e.g., reduced leaf photosynthetic rate and reduced Fv/Fm) symptoms worsened as UV exposure level increased. While the proportion of dry inflorescence yield that was derived from apical tissues decreased in both cultivars with increasing UV exposure level, total dry inflorescence yield only decreased in LT. The equivalent \u03949-THC and cannabidiol (CBD) concentrations also decreased in LT inflorescences with increasing UV exposure level. While the total terpene content in inflorescences decreased with increasing UV exposure level in both cultivars, the relative concentrations of individual terpenes varied by cultivar. The potential for using UV to enhance cannabis quality must still be confirmed before it can be used as a production tool for modern, indoor-grown cannabis cultivars.\nThe Field Guide to 3D Printing in Microscopy\nMario Del Rosario, Hannah S.

The region is simultaneously experiencing strong job growth and record venture capital inflows, along with a fierce battle of seemingly unavailable talent, small business closures, and the most expensive housing market in the U.S., with the brunt of these impacts incurred most by low-income earners and people of color.

These doses are calculated using model parameter values thought to be representative of average for North American/European populations. Considerable variability from these results can be expected for individuals. In addition, population with significant differences in stable iodine intake, and in body parameters, will have model parameters somewhat different than the ones described in this paper. These different model parameters will result in different doses from intakes of radioiodines, but it is doubtful if the differences in population would be as large as the variation between individuals. 25 refs.; 11 figs.; 1 table\n78 FR 73199 - Draft Guidance for Industry on Bioequivalence Studies With Pharmacokinetic Endpoints for Drugs...\n... exposure measures is suitable for documenting BE (e.g., transdermal delivery systems and certain rectal and...

In the reign of Ramesses III, more than two thirds of the property owned by the temples belonged to Amun, evidenced by the stupendous buildings at Karnak. Although badly ruined, no site in Egypt is more impressive than Karnak. It is the largest temple complex ever built by man, and represents the combined achievement of many generations of ancient builders. The Temple of Karnak is actually three main temples, smaller enclosed temples, and several outer temples located about three kilometers north of Luxor, Egypt situated on 100 ha (247 acres) of land. Karnak is actually the sites modern name. Its ancient name was Ipet-isut, meaning \"The Most Select (or Sacred) of Places\". This vast complex was built and enlarged over a thirteen hundred year period. The three main temples of Mut, Montu and Amun are enclosed by enormous brick walls.\nProceed to visit the Temple of Luxor"
"of Heather Graham.\nSo what might separate Twin Peaks from the new \"Golden Age\" of TV that it helped originate? The return of Special Agent Dale Cooper is crucial, even if he's only a minor character. Played by Kyle MacLachlan at his absolute dreamiest, Cooper seemed like a throwback even 25 years ago. While all of the police department in Twin Peaks are Mayberry-friendly, Cooper goes beyond even that. The whitest white-hat you can find, the purest paragon, a beacon of Zen mastery in a topsy-turvy town where demons wear denim, Canada is a den of vice, and the owls are not what they seem.\nWhile there was tragedy in Cooper's past, his baggage weighs about as much as a cotton ball compared to the moodier, much darker detectives on TV today. I'm looking at you, Rust Cohle, with your cigarettes and existential despair, and you, Will Graham, with your extreme empathy disorder and cannibal buddies. Cooper would tell you both to just have some pie, get a little fresh air for a new perspective. Hell, True Detective's King in Yellow was a red herring in the end. Cooper has to deal with Killer BOB, who actually is a pure evil deity from another dimension. And Cooper can still smile.\nHowever, the infamous tragedy of Twin Peaks was that it burned bright but brief and was cancelled with a hellacious cliffhanger. (It's been 25 years. The statute of limitations on Twin Peaks spoilers is over.) Agent Cooper was last seen leaving the Black Lodge, possessed by Killer BOB. Will the new series offer us a newer, darker, Cooper? Like Nolan's darker Batman reboot, will Twin Peaks get a modern cable makeover and kill all the beautiful, strange things about it?\nI'm hoping that Cooper will find a way back to his good self in the Black Lodge. That's what people really want to know. Okay, maybe that and \"How's Annie?\" Which leads me to wonder who might actually make it back to Twin"

These agents were able to capitalize on their opportunitiestheir cover had been well prepared and they had been careful to preserve It during periods when operationalwere not bright.\nNevertheless, one cannot rely on chance to provide anwith purpose. The untimely termination ol coverintended to be long-range is often charged to the un-sultablllty ot the agent or the Inadequacy of his cover, but close examination may reveal that the faulty element Is itself the result of an underlying failure of the planners to derive the operationorthy purpose clearly understood at the start by everyone concerned.\na lack of specific purposeery disquieting effect on agent morale. Agents sometimes express the belief thatthought Is not given by their contact man, the field station, or headquarters to the ultimate achievement that Is desired from them on their project. Their remarks areto the effect that there Isonsistent plan orthat they are given the blanket advice \"to get out and see what can be developed\" with regard to practically any political party or government agency, that they are seldom given the opportunity to learn how, If at ail. their activities are Integrated into the overall area program or objectives, and that this iseliberate effort on the part of the field station or their station contact to keep them compart-mented but rather an indication of the nonexistenceong-range plan. Such impressions, even If groundless, are not conducive to vigorous and purposeful activity.\nThe field station has an essential role to perform inthe objective as well as the meanseep-coverin Its area and it must share in the early planning.

Trolling is understandable option then. Such situation regrettably cannot be excluded in the future given the sometimes ridiculous propaganda and politics of the West. I believe that most (not only) Czechs would in such unreasonable wars recall the \u0160vejk practice. It is superficial to attribute the national character to \u0160vejks behaviour in general.\nCommenting more seriously \u2013 Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek took part in the war too and lately took part in Czech/Czechoslovak legions who fought rather succesfully in Western and mainly Eastern front, later fighting with bolsheviks to get home, helping to establish the sovereign state, btw. The story of Ha\u0161ek is even more interesting as he was later inspired by communist ideology to the degree that he switched the sides and served as a commander of bolsheviks troops for a while.\nAnd most seriously: The Austrian empire which decided century before WW1 to rely on inner and outter (Reich) Germans with their anti-Czech sentiment and oppression as at that time most economically and culturally developed nation of its Slavic majority, chose this option itself which probably was the reason for it collapse. If the Empire was wiser, we would probably celebrate rather Czech soldiers fighting well in its army perhaps in succesfull defence against turkish invasions, being represented for example by field marshal Radetzky https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Radetzky_von_Radetz\nJust a note of mistaken Western politics leading now to absurd situations like the present \u201cRussiang agent with poison in Prague\u201d.\nIs sounds like have read some Ha\u0161ek (my congratulation) but as you may have noticed, it not easy reading and much more difficult to understand for someone not quite familiar with \u201cK und K\u201d role in the first world war. \u0160vejk is"

"the good beers available on the shelves these days, Yuengling will only get a passing glance from me.\nSteve,\nYuengling is not aimed at the craft drinker. Absolutely. However, it is aimed at the mainstream drinker, and it's been our experience in PA that once drinkers break out of the 'regular' choices, try a Yuengling and find it doesn't poison them, many -- not 'most,' or 'all,' but 'many' -- of them are more willing to try something else...which has been to the benefit of craft brewers.\nDoesn't poison them, heh -- I understand the theory, Lew, But here in the midwest we've already got those kinds of beers (regionals, if you will) in the likes of Leinenkugel, Point, and even Schell. And they're all attempting their own forays into \"craft\" brewing, but their mainstays are pretty much in line with Yuengling.\nUnderstanding that this whole discussion is invalid if Y isn't even headed for this area.\nWell, sure, Steve, but...they're not America's Oldest, are they?

The oxygen's out of their room.\nFar as I know, Schell is second, about 20 years younger than Yuengling, and also still family-owned. They do a more interesting range, I'd agree. But again...Yueng's not targeting you! Be interesting to see how the Midwest works out for them.

It got my attention.It wasn\u2019t a bike race I\u2019d ever heard about before. It wasn\u2019t a race like the Tour de France with 200 riders racing each other for three weeks, nor was it just a one day event. You wouldn\u2019t even think it was a race if you saw the riders pass you by on the road. The sheer amount of crew and support needed, make it look more like an expedition!\nIt\u2019s a very simple format: Start at the west coast of America and ride all the way to the east coast in the shortest time possible. If you tire,you sleep. But as you sleep you better watch out, because your competitors are still racing. Or maybe they are sleeping as well, you don\u2019t really know.\nIt\u2019s described as a 3000 mile \u201ctime trial\u201d and is as much a test of sleep management, logistics, mental strength and patience as sheer physical endurance.\nThe key thing that stood out to me \u2013 it was open to amateurs.\nAs a club racer in Scotland, I started to get the idea that The Race Across America would be the highest level of success that someone like myself could achieve on a bike, given that I am not a professional cyclist and never will be.\nRacing in Texas \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d 2015\nAs a Consulting Systems Engineer for Cisco \u2013 I get involved in all sorts of technology projects and was asked to help build a"

The programme is designed to help children develop knowledge regarding sustainable consumption and responsible waste management while promoting their communication, reading, critical thinking and creative skills. It consists of extensively researched, fun and interactive activities for the classroom, taken from Garbology 101, which can be downloaded in English or Tamil from the WasteLess website. They are perfect both as standalone activities or complementary to other subjects such as Science, English and Mathematics. For more information on Garbology 101 please refer to this TEDx talk.\nkNOw Plastics\nWe are consuming plastic at an ever-increasing rate without knowing about its harmful effects on our environment and ourselves. Today, plastic and its negative consequences can be seen everywhere. For example, recent studies estimate that by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish. As part of the global movement to beat plastic pollution we have launched the kNOw PLASTICS Educational Programme . It is an 8-lesson programme that uses a memory style card game through which children can learn about the different types of plastics and their impact on our health, animals and the environment. It is available for free on our website.\n\u2018Pick it Up\u2019\nSince separation at source remains one of the major challenges for waste management today, we have developed a novel card game called Pick it Up.

Pick it Up teaches you how to separate and recycle your waste through the informal recycling sector while highlighting common waste items which have a high monetary value. Pick it Up targets children and is available in two versions (Tamil/English and Hindi/English). We are also currently developing an educational programme using the game as a tool. Through a series of lessons and take-home activities it empowers and motivates children to collect, separate and recycle waste anywhere in India and spread awareness to their families and friends.\nStart Upcycling\nIn collaboration with seven partners from countries including South Africa, Brazil and Germany, WasteLess as well"

"first period, high pressure in the offensive zone for the Otters would prove beneficial, as a shot in front that led to bodies crashing the net was enough for Erie to hit the twine. Peter Cjak\u2019s shot would generate a rebound right out infront of Greyhounds netminder Ethan Taylor, and would be buried by Emmett Sproule. That\u2019s good for his fourth in 17 games played this season.\nThe period would end with the lone Otters goal having them up 1-0, after twenty minutes of play.\nThe second frame would once again start with a trip to the sin bin, but this time the Hounds would find themselves on the man advantage. Marcus Gillard would head to the box for a hook.\nOnce again, Mac Hollowell couldn\u2019t let the opportunity pass him by. Much like Friday\u2019s game against the Guelph Storm, Hollowell walked into the offensive end with two defenders in front of him, but with some swift stick handling and a rocket of a shot, blasted past Murphy. Hollowell\u2019s seventh on the season would tie this game back up again, at 1-1.\nFollowing a short minute and a half later was another Otter powerplay, which would put the surprisingly low ranked Hounds power play unit (11th league wide, 17.4% power play conversion) back on the ice. This time Joseph Mack would tuck his tail between his legs and head over to the box. No goal for the hounds this time around on the man advantage.\nThe best chance for the hounds for the remainder of the second was Keeghan Howdeshell breakaway with 10:40 left. A great shot turned aside with confidence from Murphy.\nFrost came barreling into the offensive zone, but ended up getting knocked off the puck by a hard check. Frost wasn\u2019t a fan and took a shot back at the 2001 born defender Brendan Kischnick but ended up taking the lone penalty. The Greyhounds may have been able to battle a few prior penalty kills off, but not this one. Kyle Maksimovich would put the Otters back up by a goal, as his powerplay marker would help improve the powerplay record of the 10th best team"
"\u2019s no need to dig or turn over the lawn. The machines used to complete the process are fewer; the labor hours needed are fewer too.\nSince it\u2019s possible to complete the job in three to five hours, it\u2019s an efficient process. Repairing a damaged pipe isn\u2019t a small task. Broken pipes cause serious property damage and create hazardous situations for households.\nA sewage backup into the toilet, drains, or floors are inconvenient. They\u2019re also dangerous and expensive to clean.\nProcess Extends the Life of a Pipe\nEvery major home appliance has a lifespan. If you keep the appliance according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommended settings and maintenance timeline, the manufacturer expects it to live a certain amount of time without any issues. A major appliance that fails within the warranty period is defective. Thus, most manufacturers replace without too much hassle to the consumer.\nPipes are major engineering feats. Even an Orangeburg pipe has a lifespan of 50 years. Cast iron, cement, and PVC pipes last between 75 to 100 years.\nSeptic systems consist of five components including the tank, drain lines, and pump. The septic lifespan depends on the component. The total system lasts up to 40 years. However, the tank lasts up to 20 years while the drain lines can last up to 40.\nSometimes a repair helps the appliance and the homeowner. Leaks in pipes are a warning sign. Opting for the lining repair option helps extend the life of the pipe. Keep in mind that a pipe needs to qualify for this repair first. If the plumbing professionals believe that it\u2019s beneficial, they\u2019ll recommend this procedure instead of a replacement.\nEpoxy pipe lining has a lifespan between 35 to 50 years. When it\u2019s successful, it expands the life of the pipe too.\nTo schedule Selden,NY pipe lining services, call Long Island Water and Sewer Main at 800-479-5325.

"were interested in a nearly ubiquitous element of modern shoes that has not been studied before: the upward curvature at the front of the shoe.\u2019\nThe project began after the professors met at a conference in Boston \u2013 and went for a run by the Charles River. They talked about foot biomechanics \u2013 and plantar fasciitis.\nThe MTP joints are one of the key features that have evolved so humans can walk and run on two feet so effectively and efficiently. An average person in the UK and other industrialised countries takes 4,000 to 6,000 steps a day.\nHabitually wearing shoes with toe springs is likely to relieve muscles of the work needed to strengthen the joints, said the researchers.\nExperts analysed participants walking on a treadmill (Credits: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\nProf Sichting said: \u2018Walking in shoes with comfortable features such as a toe spring has its costs.\u2019\nBut the researchers are not expecting toe springs to be ditched anytime soon. The global footwear market is worth more than \u00a3150 billion a year.\nProf Lieberman said: \u2018We like comfort. That is why we sit in chairs and take elevators.\u2019\nThe researchers are now calling for more research into how toe springs interact with other elements of shoes \u2013 such as stiff soles or cushioning.\nAdded co author Dr Oliver Hansen, also from Harvard: \u2018This study isolated just one element of our shoes. This could give us a more complete picture of how shoes affect our biomechanics.\u2019\nA-list celebrities who have suffered from plantar fasciitis include Paris Hilton, Angelina Jolie and Elaine Paige.\nAccording to the NHS Choices website, it can be brought on by doing too much exercise, having flat feet, being overweight \u2013 or wearing unsuitable shoes.\nSource: metro.co.uk<s> Square des Fr\u00e8res-Charon / Affleck de la Riva architects\n\u00a9 Marc Cramer\nhttps://www.archdaily.com/50456/square-des-fre%25cc%2580res-charon-affleck"

"37 etc.\nDuring the pandemic, several public health measures were already implemented in Bangladesh, which is being alleged for aggravating the risk of mental instabilities. Besides this, the online learning process, the alternative way of running educational activities after the inception of the pandemic, reportedly plays a significant role in exacerbating psychological sufferings.24\u201326 Online schooling turns to issues related to lack of concentration on the study, agitation, dissatisfaction with academic studies, which are reported for intensifying psychological burdens.32,34 Therefore, student cohorts are allegedly at risk of mental health sufferings because of lockdown-related issues.\nThe present review is the first systematic approach considering students\u2019 mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh, which is anticipated to be helpful for the mental health authorities. However, students are found at immense risk of psychological suffering, that is, the prevalence rate of depression, anxiety, and stress ranges from 46.92% to 82.4%, 26.6% to 96.82%, and 28.5% to 70.1%, respectively. These prevalence rates across studies may vary because of utilizing different tools, and cutoff scores of the same instrument.38 Besides this, pandemic-related issues such as COVID-19 infection rate of the participants\u2019 area, history of the COVID-19 infection, financial difficulties, etc., may increase the probability of higher mental health suffering.32,37,39\u201342 These issues are not identified across the included studies, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Despite these limitations of the included studies, the estimated prevalence rates of mental disorders are supposed to be helpful in representing the cautious situation rather than reflecting as factual findings.\nBased on the present findings, mental disorders\u2019 risk factors related to basic socio-demographics included younger age, gender, lower family monthly income, lower grade education status, urban residence, family size, living with family/parents, and having children in the family. Also, behavior and health-related mental health risk factors included being smokers, lack of physical exercise, reporting more internet use time, and dissatisfaction with sleeping status"

"which people lived in balance with nature are for Fabiani the matter of his study that feeds his artistic modus operandi.\nHe, therefore, tries to recover these natural and ancestral elements through the use of wooden planks and jute canvas with which he realises site-specific compositions. These found elements, easily discovered on field by the artist, thus become an integral part of the installation and they consolidate with the territory where the work is conceived and realised. A perfect fusion between the natural elements and the place of realisation. The anchoring to the ground or the suspension of these structures through ropes and cables allow a non-invasive interaction between the work, the environment and those who habitually live those spaces, redefining the symbolic meaning of that place. These elements of drafting or fixing are however to be considered not as simple technical tools but as real graphic compositions that extend the distinctive visual mark of the artist. Strength vectors that interact with his typical drawing lines. These graphic profiles, in fact, are fundamental in his artistic research made not only of ropes and strips but of drawings that investigate and research the forms of organic plant and animal beings, which wander on the surface of paper, canvas, wood or polyethylene. The extension of the design is also found in the search for three-dimensional structures, primary forms such as the cone, the cylinder, the rectangle that suggest small spaces of shelter and thought for those who take refuge inside. The artisanal practices of Daniele Fabiani are actually veritable Vitruvian architectural research where the natural element is an integral and fundamental part of each his artistic construct.\n\u201cDe Natura\u201d Ph. credit Francesca Rossignoli\nDaniele Fabiani, Emisferi, 2017.

Inoffensive.\nNose: Some have said wonderful nose, some have said weird. For me this was good especially after a few drops of water. Floral notes with stone fruits.\nTaste: Not overly complex with apricots being the strongest of the stone fruits coming through. There was defiantly some sweetness but dare I say I could not recognise the source.\nNose: Musky and dry. Not quite grass but more so hay and strangely a fruity milky note almost like a fruit smoothie but not quite.\nTaste: Kiwi, lemon, mango, butter and a cheesecake base. For me this was like a deconstructed cheesecake followed by a shot of lighted roasted espresso.\nNose: Very different on the nose. Soapy undertones which people quickly liken to chemical, plasticine and paint. For me it was definitely soapy bubbles.\nTaste: A chalky almost powder texture with a nuts roasted in salted butter.\nNose: Prawns and seafood were mentioned on the night although I couldn\u2019t get any of this. I was getting the costal notes with pears drizzled in honey.\nTaste: Again the pears coming through but now it was smoked pears and the honey has turned to caramel.\nNose: Costal and maritime with bananas and peanut butter.\nTaste: Nice texture, complex fruit, smoke, and richness.\nThe next club tasting comes from Scapa, and will be held on the evening of Wednesday 2nd September.\nWorm Tubs\nJuly has started very well indeed.

"-structured interviews with classroom teachers and school leaders and semi-structured focus groups with students. Interviews and focus groups were guided by topic guides that explored staff and student experiences of the program including perceived need for the program, program implementation, program impacts and suggested improvements. Open-ended questions aimed to capture in-depth descriptions of the experiences and impacts of the project on staff, students and schools.\nDemographic characteristics of the sample by individual school and by study arm (comparison and intervention) were described. Multilevel mixed effect models were used for analysis of pre- and post- survey findings to account for the non-independence in the data, in our case paired data on individual students within a school. These models also enabled the analysis to make use of all data available, that is participants with baseline or follow up data only as well as those with data at both timepoints. A linear mixed model was fitted for each of the continuous outcomes and a logistic mixed model was fitted for each of the categorical outcomes. This study is both a pre-post study design and control/ intervention study, therefore in the models an interaction term is included. The interaction term is included in the model to quantify the effect of the intervention, as this represents the difference between study group (intervention compared to control) and the time period (post vs pre). A statistical difference is quantified as a p value of less than 0.05.\nFollowing transcription of the recordings, interviews and focus groups were thematically coded and analysed using NVivo. The coding framework was developed using a combination of theoretically-driven (a priori) and inductively from the data. The data was analysed under ten thematic nodes. Staff and student data were analysed separately. Multiple researchers conducted coding and discussed findings iteratively with each other during the analysis process, as well as with the wider research team, to triangulate findings, enhance reflexivity and reduce the risk of bias.\nCharacteristics of the study population\nThe participating schools spanned metropolitan, outer metropolitan and regional areas across NSW and Victoria. School characteristics and demographic characteristics of participating students by school and by intervention and comparison group are shown in Table 1. A total of 252 students completed surveys across the two comparison schools"
"examples of this are an animal with a broken limb, one that cannot walk in a normal way, one whose limbs are noticeably disproportionate to one another or relative to its species, or a blind animal. All told, there are 73 different imperfections that invalidate a korban as a baal mum (Sefer Hachinuch). Were a kohen to offer the imperfect offering of a gentile, he would be violating the Torah\u2019s express prohibition and be liable for the resultant punishments. For an in-depth discussion of this topic, the intrepid reader is referred to Minchas Chinuch, Mitzvah 292. The same author mentions that the laws governing a gentile\u2019s korban may, in one situation, actually be more stringent that those governing a Jew\u2019s korban. The details of how this could happen are beyond the scope of this article.\nTreatment of Holy Bulls and Sheep\nThere are a few differences in halachah between the korban olah offering of a Jew and that of a gentile. Prior to a Jew offering a korban, he rests his hands on the head of the animal and presses down on the animal\u2019s head. This procedure is called semichah, and, while doing so, the owner of the korban recites viduy, confessing his sins. However, when a gentile\u2019s offering is brought, no semichah is performed (Temurah 2a).\nThere is another curious difference between the olah offered by a gentile and that offered by a Jew. When a Jew consecrates an animal as a korban olah, someone who subsequently uses the consecrated animal, such as one who sheared the wool of a consecrated ram or worked a consecrated bull, violates a serious prohibition of the Torah called me\u2019ilah. The individual who committed this prohibition negligently must offer a special korban called an asham as atonement. However, when a gentile donates an olah there is no prohibition min haTorah to use the animal and there is no violation of the prohibition of me\u2019ilah. The Gemara concludes that using the consecrated animal is prohibited only miderabbanan (Temurah"
"Dutta et al. [30] reported the administration of packed cell and double volume exchange transfusions in the neonatal period as major risk factors for the development of threshold ROP. There is a need to study prospectively, the maternal factors responsible for severe ROP in heavier babies.\nThe results of our study also raise the issue of screening criteria for ROP in our part of the world. From the West, Goble et al. [21] in their series reported that none of the babies with birth weight > 1250 g developed threshold ROP and in fact, did not recommend screening for babies > 1250 g at birth. In contrast, Gilbert [26] reported that lowering birth weight criteria would expose a small number of larger babies who are at risk for developing threshold ROP. More recently, in a study comparing the spectrum of ROP between developed and lesser developed countries, 13% of infants from the poorly developed nations exceeded the screening criteria followed in the United Kingdom. [7] A recent study by Chiang et al. [28] looked at a very large database of neonates from New York State in the United States and found that 17 infants with ROP were > 2000 g birth weight, but none required any treatment. In our study, 12 infants were > 2000 g, of which four had threshold or worse ROP. The Vietnam study [3] reported cases of severe blinding ROP in infants up to 1800 g at birth. A recent study from China [31] retrospectively analyzed infants treated for ROP Stages 3, 4 and 5. They found that 27.2% of these babies were > 1500 g at birth. In view of blinding disease in higher birth weight babies in developing countries, we may need to modify screening criteria to suit locally prevalent conditions.\nThe fact that screening of 'heavy' babies may be missed when we adhere to the western guidelines is evident from our data. When we applied the guidelines recommended by the American Academy of Ophthalmology [6] on our study group, 11 babies (17.7%"

") of that desired service, in a given domain, using standard DNS-queries. The commercial pre-cursor to the IETF standardized solution was by Apple Computer and was referred to as \u201cAppleTalk\u201d (sometimes also referred to as \u201cBonjour\u201d). See RFC 676, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.\nIn IETF, an IP \u201cservice\u201d is recognized by a combination of three pieces of information that includes a service name (e.g., FTP, HTTP), a transport protocol (e.g., UDP, TCP), and a port number of the transport protocol. An extensive registry of known Internet IP services is maintained by IETF in a service name and transport protocol port number registry. See http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.\nTechnically, DNS-SD is composed of two functions. The first function is referred to as multicast DNS (mDNS). mDNS provides the ability to perform local network DNS operations in the absence of any conventional unicast DNS server by utilizing local IP multicast functionality. Thus, devices can directly answer local IP multicast DNS queries themselves instead of requiring dedicated DNS servers to respond to the query (e.g., a printer will directly answer multicast DNS queries looking for printing services). mDNS also allows devices to pro-actively advertise their supported/changed services using link-local multicast. In addition, mDNS designates a portion of the DNS namespace to be free for local use (e.g., a new \u201c.local\u201d domain), without the need to pay any annual fee, and without the need to set up delegations or otherwise configure a conventional DNS server to answer for those names. See RFC 6762, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.\nThe second function is itself (a bit confusingly) called DNS-SD. It is described in RFC 6763 (which is incorporated by reference in its entirety) and specifies the changes required within the DNS record structure to support service discovery queries (e.g., configuring DNS to support more than the classical name resolution queries). It can also be used in a pure unicast mode for querying for specific"

"nering market share. I frankly don\u2019t see that changing any time soon.\nOn the high-performance end, it\u2019s a hard call. C++ has ruled this roost for two decades and has received some recent updates that look great. But Rust seems to have a strictly better type system, which provides better compile-time code verification with equivalent or better performance.\nEdit to add: People keep talking about C. C is the low-level language of the past. Like COBOL, there\u2019s a crap ton of code written for it, so it won\u2019t just vanish. But except in narrow cases, I don\u2019t see C as being a good language for new development. Rust is strictly better for anything that you might want to start in C today. I think this will be increasingly true. So in that respect, Rust may be more likely to be a major language in the future.\nEdit to add: C# is probably going to persist in some enterprise companies and as the language of Unity3d and Xamarin.\nEdit to add: Go might survive due to strong Google backing, though I have a hard time recommending it.\nEdit to add: Swift is likely to stick around as the Apple platform language for the foreseeable future. But it doesn\u2019t seem likely to make the jump anywhere else.\nThe first language will be the hardest because you\u2019re learning how to program at all.

Reaction time, along with agility, coordination, balance, speed and power, are key components of skill-related fitness. Good reaction time translates to success in sports and in life activities that require strong motor skills. It\u2019s also one of the critical factors for safeguarding health and independence as you age.\nMuscle Reactions\nActivity engages fast twitch and slow twitch muscles. Fast twitch muscle fibers are the ones that control reaction time and agility. They excel in the explosive, brief anaerobic moves of the sprinter and the weightlifter, and it takes a powerful force to enlist them. Experts at the Miami Valley Hospital Sports Medicine Center recommend specific training for improved agility and reaction time with exercises such as ladder drills, reaction balls and plyometric jumping. Aerobic activity utilizes slow twitch muscles first so, in order to get to the fast twitch response, you have to instill the habit with repetitive anaerobic exercise. But the training is worth the trouble. Faster reaction time gives you a significant competitive edge in sports and helps to protect you from injury in daily life.\nTalent, Tendency and Experience\nReaction time depends on a number of factors that are influenced by genetics and years of practice. The best athletes are better at \"reading\" their opponents. They scan constantly for more information, analyze visual clues more intently and rapidly than average players and use their experience and skills to select the most advantageous response. Peak Performance lists several indicators of rapid reaction time that include visual acuity: sharp eyesight; contrast sensitivity: the ability to see clearly in variable light conditions and to distinguish among shades of gray; and auditory acuity"

He also sustained what he calls a \u201cbruised brain\u201d which brought with it long, excruciating headaches that tormented him throughout the past year. Mr. Clooney eventually underwent several surgeries which remedied his pain, but he also reportedly experienced memory and cognitive problems, suggesting that the injury was more severe than the press may understand. The Movement 101 physiotherapist also helped in a lot in his pain relief journey.\nTo me, this is a great example of how the media treats traumatic brain injury, and how culture works to obfuscate the real and lasting effects of a brain injury. Mr. Clooney has a career at stake, so it is probably in his financial interest to keep quiet about the more difficult effects his injury has caused. Did it give him problems memorizing his lines? Did he develop any depressive or anxiety-based symptoms? Is he prone to angry outbursts now? Over time, we may see a side to Mr. Clooney that reveals a more human aspect of brain injury, and hopefully those stories will propel greater advocacy. As it stands, I\u2019m disappointed that his brain injury has been dismissed as a negligible bump on the head.\nClick here to read about George Clooney\u2019s Head Injury.\nGEORGE CLOONEY | Traumatic brain injury made him think of suicide | IN THE CULTURE OF ON"

", on average, $3.7 billion annually. The long-term (1940 to 1999) average number of lives lost was 110 people each year and these deaths were mostly the result of flash floods.\nOn the 14th of June 1990 in Shadyside, Ohio, USA, 101.6 mm of rain fell in less than two hours. This produced a 9 m high wall of water. Twenty six people died and about $7 million worth of damages occurred.\nFlash floods occur within six hours of a rain event or after a dam bursts or a river embankment fails. They can also occur when water is suddenly released from behind an ice or debris jam. Flash floods often catch people unaware. The best response to any signs of flash flooding is to move immediately and quickly to higher ground.\n2. source: http://www.dd.org/~tale/\nminden-flood/page3/\nIntense rainfall during storms creates small, fast moving streams of water. These streams of water can have enough power to wash away sections of pavement and parts of houses. The lack of water permeable ground in urban environments makes the situation worse. Urbanisation increases water runoff two to six times over what would occur on a natural terrain. During periods of urban flooding, streets can become swift moving rivers, while basements and underpasses can become death traps as they fill with water.\n3.

While performance data showed that the predicted optimal task combinations indeed resulted in minimal interference between tasks, the preferential choice data showed that a third of participants did not show any adaptation, and for the remainder it took a considerable number of trials before the optimal task combinations were chosen consistently. On the basis of these results we argue that, while in principle people are able to adapt their behavior according to multitasking demands, selection of the most efficient combination of strategies is not an automatic process.\nIon beam simulation SIMION OS/2: 1 200 000 points, multitasking and new options\nJune 1993 \u00b7 Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms\nDominique Huyskens\nPeter De Bisschop\nTrudo Clarysse\nWilfried"

Saint Mungo founded the city of Glasgow in the 6th century when many of the city\u2019s churches and major sites underwent original construction. As time passed, Glasgow grew in population and in industries like shipbuilding and textiles. After World War II, the city experienced a decline in economic prosperity, but modern revitalization efforts have breathed new life into it. Today, over half a million people live in Glasgow.\nGlasgow Port Facilities & Location\nGreenock cruise port is the primary cruise terminal where you\u2019ll disembark. After admiring the beautiful views of the Clyde River, you can take a taxi or train to get into Glasgow, which takes around half an hour. You can hang out in Greenock if you want to stay central to the cruise terminal, but heading into town will yield beautiful natural and mountain views before you explore Glasgow.\nTransportation in Glasgow\nBike rentals are popular in Glasgow, and taxis are abundant.

".\nThe perils of being open and transparent\nThere\u2019s an old Chinese saying: \u201cThe nail that protrudes, gets hammered down.\u201d Many languages have an equivalent of \u201cto stick your neck out\u201d or \u201cput your backside on the line\u201d. The takeout here: sharing information that could reflect badly on you carries risks. We humans are a collection of biases and emotions; we have a tendency to assign blame to the messenger who discovered the problem, rather than to the factors that caused the problem itself.\nThe transport industry has long operated behind a curtain, with few customers having true visibility on what\u2019s happening within the box. And in truth, if you search YouTube for footage of what happens every day on loading ramps and sorting hubs, you\u2019d look closer at things like insurance and service levels in contracts.\nAny lack of trust resulting from lack of information and negative experiences results in slow execution of processes, poor accountability standards and finger pointing. This all contributes to slow changes in how transport is managed, and customers remain in the dark.\nNow imagine the alternative. If every customer enjoys full transparency and visibility over their cargo\u2014with supply chain monitoring technology or a rail freight sensor and IoT gateway system\u2014the market would work as markets should: customers demand improvement, suppliers innovate to offer it. But this isn\u2019t yet the case.\nSmart container monitoring\u2014like Nexxiot\u2019s technology\u2014makes a lot of your critical cargo data visible, complete with associated risks. Temperature rising inside a reefer? GPS position suggesting a delay tonight? Two hazardous shipments in close proximity? All available.\nBut the shipping firm or logistics provider that enables that asset monitoring counterintuitively may feel it is putting itself at a potential disadvantage. The concern can be that end customers see a reality they weren\u2019t previously aware of. So it can feel like making it visible is a business risk \u2026. And it can feel like a personal one too.\nCognitive biases: the prime suspect in perceived risk\nAnd that\u2019s the key point: personal. People\u2019s understanding of risk is deeply emotional. We put undue weight on a tiny risk that\u2019s constantly talked about, like a plane crash; we avoid mitigating obvious future risks because they provide comfort"

Knowing little about stained glass, he went to Germany to seek craftsmen to assist him. While there he was deeply influenced by the sharply detailed paintings of various German and Flemish masters of the 16th century. Wood subsequently abandoned his Impressionist style and began to paint in the sharply detailed, realistic manner by which he is now known.\nA portrait of his mother in this style, Woman with Plants (1929), did not attract attention, but in 1930 his American Gothic caused a sensation when it was exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago. The hard, cold realism of this painting and the honest, direct, earthy quality of its subject were unusual in American art. The work ostensibly portrays a farmer and his daughter\u2014modelled for Wood by his dentist, B.H. McKeeby, and Wood\u2019s sister, Nan\u2014in front of their farmhouse.

"to take its toll on global markets, it is essential that every digital-first brand learns about the latest digital marketing trends and adapts to them as quickly as possible.\nHere are some of the most recent trends in digital marketing that every brand looking for a virtual presence must account for.\nThe Rise of Business Messaging & Chatbots\nMarketing chatbots are an AI-tailored technology that ensures spontaneous responses to customer queries and increases customer engagement. With this round-the-clock customer support tool, businesses can drive audiences from the awareness to the consideration funnel by educating them about the product and also build brand image by communicating and resolving consumer queries.\nHere\u2019s an example of how an AI-tailored chatbot would work:\nSource: Social Beat\nHaving said that, the digital marketing trends in 2023 might demand that we take it up a notch. While great for resolving minor/easy consumer queries, we need to focus on adding a human touch to our responses (both audio and textual). This will not just help you in driving conversions, but will also help in improving your customer retention rate through personalised engagements.\nTip: Customer personas can contribute to personalising your responses by helping you understand which tonality is best consumed by your customers.\nHaving talked about marketing chatbots, and automated responses, another crucial digital marketing trend is the improved efficiency of marketing automation platforms.\nMarketing Automation Will Become an Ally to Customer-First Brands\nAs popularly said by Sam Walton- \u201cThere is only one boss- The Customer.\u201d\nCustomer experience has been a crucial digital marketing trend in every form of marketing and that aspect is not going to change anytime soon. However, with the precarious recession times that gradually plague the year 2022, CX will now be a cutthroat competition amongst brands.\nWhile customer experience and personalisation have been in the talks for almost a decade now, only a handful of companies seem to have cracked this code.

"branch of business.\nCurrently, wage and work guarantees are found in relatively few\ncollective bargaining agreements, but they vary widely as to the\ntype and amount o f the guarantee, eligibility for the guarantee,\nconditions under which the guarantee may be terminated, and re\u00ad\nlated provisions.1 Some guarantee a year\u2019s normal income or w ork;\nothers guarantee employment for much shorter periods. Some guar\u00ad\nantees are limited to a minimum number of hours a week. The guar\u00ad\nantee may cover the employer\u2019s entire labor force, or only a designated\nnumber or group of employees (those with a minimum period of\nservice; those in a certain craft or type of work, certain \u201ckey\u201d em\u00ad\nployees; a \u201cbasic crew,\u201d etc.). Many include \u201cescape\u201d clauses which\nspecify conditions under which the employer is released from his\nobligation to provide work. Some plans have detailed provisions\nregarding the effect of employees\u2019 absence from work, holidays, vaca\u00ad\ntions, and other types of time off; the employer\u2019s right to transfer\nemployees to any available work; and penalty rates for overtime\nIn some agreements, the employer merely pledges to provide regular\nemployment to the best of his ability, or to study the possibility of\ninstituting a guarantee.\nAnnual Guarantees\nAnnual guarantee plans in collective bargaining agreements are o f\ntwo general types\u2014 those guaranteeing employment and those guaran\u00ad\nteeing annual wages. The former assures a minimum number of\nhours, days, weeks, or months of work each year, without specifying\nthe amount of earnings to be received. A year\u2019s job (or in some\ncases, a fraction of a year) is guaranteed, but the employee\u2019s total\nannual income varies. For example, it is impossible to determine\nin advance and, therefore, guarantee the annual earnings of an em\u00ad\nployee who is paid on a piece-rate or incentive basis or on a com\u00ad\nbined hourly rate and incentive pay basis. Transfers to different\njobs at different rates of pay also complicate the forecasting of earn\u00ad\nings. For these reasons, most"
"150,000 who died in the December 26 tsunami, evangelicals in the United Methodist Church are mourning the passing of Bill Hinson, who died the same day at age 68\nHinson, longtime pastor of Houston's First United Methodist Church until his retirement in 2001, was one of the founders of the denomination's Confessing Movement, which represents 675,000 conservatives in the church, and was serving as its president. He recently made headlines with his call for an \"amicable separation\" in the denomination.\nHinson's death comes just days after that of another leading evangelical in the United Methodist Church, Ed Robb. In his 78 years, Robb founded or helped to lead most of the major renewal organizations within Methodism, sitting on the boards of the Confessing Movement, Good News, the Mission Society for United Methodists, and Asbury Theological Seminary, founded A Foundation for Theological Education, and helped to start the Institute on Religion and Democracy.\nOther important deaths of late are Greek Orthodox leader Anthony Gergiannakis, who led believers in seven Western U.S. states, and New Testament scholar-giant Carsten Thiede, most known for his dating the gospels of Matthew and Mark to a few decades after Jesus' death. His most recent work, to be published in a book he was finishing at the time of his death, identifies the biblical village of Emmaus as the present-day Motza-Kolonia.\nMore deaths:\nTheologian criticized by Vatican dies | The Rev.

"likely to change or charge), which had entirely free schemes years before 2008 and say \u201cUnfair\u201d. Already English pass-holders do not get the all-day concessions given to the Scots (somewhat amusingly called \u201centitlement cards\u2019) and Welsh, so to charge on top of that would seem very unfair. However, I see nothing wrong in a payment being made at time of issue provided EVERYONE in the UK (and I mean London as well) is treated the same. Cards are normally issued for a four year period and thus a \u00a3400 (\u00a3100pa, \u00a32 per week) payment (\u00a3200 if on income support) would not seem unreasonable. This would at least cover some of the shortfalls and admin costs so resented by the Councils who had the scheme foisted upon them by H.M. Government. And if the government of the day realise it will be a vote loser, they may just smartly decide to fund the scheme properly, although it needs to be remembered that ultimately it is Tax Payer\u2019s money.\nSteve W says:\nSurely, if the theory is that bus operators are no better or no worse off (ha!), since you wouldn\u2019t have made these trips if you\u2019d had to pay \u00a330 or so, the bus operators should receive precisely nothing\u2026\nFurther to my comments last November about machine rejection of valid ENCTS cards, I had the same experience in late December on Bluestar buses in Southampton; but being busy over the Christmas pperiod I didn\u2019t bother to contact Bluestar and moan that they were rejecting my Cambs CC card when Stagecoach and First Hampshire were quite happy with it. But then the same thing happened on 14th March on Brighton & Hove route 12X, and this time I did email to complain. In contrast to NatEx, Transdev and Trentbarton, the reply from David Brown (!) in Conway Street was dismissive and unhelpful, telling me that my card had been cancelled or damaged and quoting the phone number for Cambs CC (which I already had on the card). I phoned them and they agreed with me that the card had not been cancelled, so the fault must lie in Brighton"

"from his place on the ground and carried the wooden boy to the woman and placed it in her arms.\n\"But\", said the woman.\n\"Yours\", said the man, \"The child for which you wished\".\nThe woman looked down at the lifeless lump of wood, confused. And then a smile cracked the walnut shell of the old man's face and a spark lit in the depths of his eye.\n\"Fear not\", he said, \"for long ago I was taught a little of the Absented's word and I shall speak it to the boy\".\nAnd then he picked up a spill of wood from the fire and lit the candle that lay where the wooden boy's heart should have been. And at the same time he brought his lips to the wooden boy's ear and whispered something. And then the wind sighed and the leaves of the old oak shivered and the flame of the boy's candle heart flickered. And then the boy opened his eyes.\n\"Mother\", he said, looking up into the woman's eyes, which were wide and filled with tears.\n\"Child\", she said and took the boy's hand in her own.\nAnd then the wind stirred once more and the flame of the boy's candle heart flickered a moment and the boy trembled.\n\"The candle will not burn down\", said the old man, \"but the flame must be kept alive. For, if it were to fail ...\" And then he shook his head and looked down towards the ground.\nThe woman nodded and held the boy tight to her, shielding him from the wind. And when she looked up from him, she and the boy were alone and the old man had disappeared into the gathering dark. So the woman took the candleheart boy home.\nThat was a long and windless summer, such as the world used to have when it was still young, full of blue skies and bright suns and the sound of laughter. And much of that laughter came from the candleheart boy and his mother, who found great joy in each other and, in doing so, found great joy in themselves.\nAutumn came, as it almost always does, and loosed summer's grip upon the world.

"men\u2019s fashion magazines. But how did the bomber jacket come to have such a lasting place in our closets?\nBomber jackets \u2014 along with their mighty cousin, the varsity jacket \u2014 originate from the flight jacket. The flight jacket was a casual option for pilots that eventually became a popular and lasting fashion item. Early iterations of the flight jacket, for pilots flying planes in World War I, had to be seriously warm because the cockpits weren\u2019t enclosed. With planes becoming much more technologically advanced by World War II, pilots were flying at higher altitudes with the cabins closed but uninsulated, so flight jackets still had to be pretty heavy. The American military has one of the more iconic bomber jackets \u2014 the MA-1. The classic bomber jacket\u2019s green silk nylon and orange lining has lasted in civilian wear well after the jacket was officially retired by the military.\nImagery of war heroes naturally proliferated and influenced the imaginations of fashion designers as they dreamt up men\u2019s fashion collections. Even if it was unconscious, men\u2019s fashion designers were replicating and selling a masculine look driven by the constant imagery of what a strong man was supposed to look like. In the 70s, the bomber jacket started to make its way into the fashion realm of various subcultures. These days, it\u2019s most often associated with street style. Even with its origins in the military, the bomber jacket has essentially become a neutral clothing item that anyone can own.\nWhen the bomber jacket came to be adopted by English skinheads in the late \u201870s and early \u201880s, it developed a more sinister association for a spell. As a counter-response to the far-right\u2019s obsession with masculinity, the bomber jacket transformed into a staple item of London\u2019s LGBTQ community. This subversion of the bomber jacket is actually what turned it into a popular item that then made its way through so many different fashion aesthetics. Without the work of the gay community, the bomber jacket would have stayed associated with problematic beliefs and ultimately would not have been adopted by high-fashion designers"

But they have to work to build that situational awareness, based on little half-second blips and buzzes that pulse on their threat receivers, and there is no time to spare, since modern missiles have the speed and range to kill virtually anything that can be detected, very quickly.

The sensitivity for one-field non-mydriatic photography was 86.0% (95% CI, 80.9\u201391.1%), the specificity was 76.7% (95% CI, 74.5\u201378.9%) and the poor-quality image rate was 19.7% (95% CI, 18.4\u201321.0%). The sensitivity for two-field mydriatic photography was 87.8% (95% CI, 83.0\u201392.6%), the specificity was 86.1% (95% CI, 84.2\u201387.8%) and a poor-quality image rate was 3.7% (95% CI, 3.1\u20134.3%). This study led to the approach used in England of two-field mydriatic photography and the approach in Scotland of staged mydriasis with one-field non-mydriatic photography and with dilation only if poor-quality images were obtained. The correlation [18] with age led Northern Ireland to only routinely dilate those aged 50 years and over.\nIt has been demonstrated that there is a strong correlation [18] between age and poor-quality image rates in diabetic retinopathy screening, for both non-mydriatic and mydriatic photography. Hence, publications [19,20,21,22] with small numbers in a young age range are not relevant to population-based screening programmes where many of the individuals to be screened are over 60 years.\nIn any population-based screening programme, it is necessary to balance acceptability to the individuals being screened and cost-effectiveness of the screening"

The lawmaker wrote: \u201cWe appreciate that you\u2019ve been candid in your discussions about what happened at FTX. Your willingness to talk to the public will help the company\u2019s customers, investors, and others. To that end, we would welcome your participation in our hearing on the 13th.\u201d\nMany people quickly pointed out to Waters that the former FTX chief executive is a fraud and should be arrested on sight. Some people have even compared Bankman-Fried and the FTX implosion to Bernie Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t arrest him I will have lost all faith in our government being the tiniest bit of just,\u201d bitcoin proponent Dan Held replied to Waters.\nLawyer Jake Chervinsky responded to the congresswoman: \u201cRep. Waters, we appreciate that you\u2019re holding a hearing on the 13th, and we look forward to substantive fact-finding about what happened at FTX.\u201d He added:\nI am certain that factfinding will show that SBF has not, in fact, been candid in his discussions. He committed fraud, full stop.\nHowever, many people are not surprised by Waters\u2019 tweet given her good relations with Bankman-Fried. At the conclusion of a congressional hearing last year, she even appeared to be blowing kisses at SBF. Some people also pointed out that the former FTX executive gave $300K to Waters\u2019 committee members.\nCrypto exchange FTX collapsed and filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11.

Each is different. CLucene and Lucene have the same syntax. I presume BPBible and MacSword have a different one.\nEven with Lucene and CLucene, there are differences. JSword can use a SWORD index, but SWORD can't use a JSword index. The reason is that JSword is using Lucene 2.x and Clucene is compatible with 1.4.x. These have different storage formats. CLucene will never catch up with Lucene. We moved away from 1.4.x for outrageous performance gains.\nThe other thing that JSword has (and I think some others do) is passage restricted searching.

This was a series that was centered around hearth and home, sex and salvation, faith and family. It was at times hugely operatic (Season Four, I'm looking at you), Shakespearean, or pared-down (the final season).\nBut what Big Love accomplished was to deliver a look into a family that was markedly different, perhaps, than our own, but which also had the same growing pains, the same fears, the same desires that each of us face within our own families, whether traditional or nontraditional. It charted the way that we each need to find our independence and also find strength in one another, the way in which we can lean on our loved ones and struggle to understand them. It was, at the end of the day, about love.\nIt's fitting then that the series finale of Big Love (\"Where Men and Mountains Meet\"), written by series creators Mark V.

The \u2018post-industrial\u2019 society is altogether distinct, isn\u2019t based on hoarding, production-consumption (\u2018prosumer\u2019) is based on \u20183rd wave\u2019 knowledge-intensive technologies and renewable energy sources, knowledge cannot be hoarded.\nI need not articulate further, do I? They all converged on one theme: capitalism is transitory, it bred social maladies (alienation, dehumanization, anomie, conspicuous consumption,\u2026), is systemically flawed, and will be dismantled at sometime in the future.\nNo matter how delimited their theories maybe, as they all proceeded from certain perspectives (they were all \u2018paradigm\u2019-based in the jargon of Thomas Kuhn), they all proclaimed\u2014in either tacit or explicit fashion\u2014the coming demise of the system. They weren\u2019t as silly as Fukuyama who popularized seemingly \u2018satanic verses\u2019 (distorted precepts) about a non-changing, permanent economic landscape called \u2018liberal capitalism\u2019, but were rather so adroit at social forecasting that they saw a vision of the future as they were articulating on their empirical observations of the present society.\nSo, fellows out there, prepare for the months and years ahead. We are headed towards those stormy months, years, maybe even decades. How the future society will come to shape is not easy to forecast. \u201cSomething blurs the Force, darkens our sight of the future,\u201d declared a Jedi Master in the Star Wars cinema fame."

"of Numa. p. 62. Edit. Wech. Vol. I. Grotius.\nI am surprised that our Author has not quoted the following remarkable Passage of Cicero, which is much more express, and more to his Purpose than those, to which he refers us. Since therefore nothing is more excellent than Reason, which is common to God and Man, the first rational Society is between God and Man. For where there is a Participation of Reason, there is also a mutual Participation of right Reason. Now this being a Law, we are to conclude a Society between the Gods and Men founded on Law. Farther, where there is one common Law, there is likewise a common Right; and those who hold these in common, are to be esteem\u2019d, as it were, fellow-citizens. De Legib. Lib. I. Cap. VII. But, properly speaking, there is no Law, or Right common to God and Man. See Pufendorf B. II. \u00a7 3. and Chap. III. \u00a7 5, 6. As also Mr. Thomasius\u2019s Dissertation call\u2019d, Philosophia Juris, de Obligat. & Action. which is the third in the Collection printed at Leipsic. Cap. I. \u00a7 8, &c.\n[16. ] This Restriction is to be carefully observed. For, as Ziegler very well remarks on this Place, in all Dealings between a Superior and an Inferior, independently of the Relation of Superiority, the Right of Equality takes Place, as amongst Equals; thus, for Example, Contracts between a Prince and one of his Subjects require no other Rules than those which ought to be observed between two private Persons. When a Merchant has sold his Goods to his King, the King is as much obliged to pay for them, on the Terms, and at the Time agreed on, as the meanest Purchaser. To which I add, that there are some Cases, wherein a Superior becomes in certain Respects the Inferior; and that then the Right of Superiority is changed in Regard to the same Persons, according to the Nature of the Things. Thus a Magistrate is bound to honour his Parents, and consequently to submit to their"
"setup to catch leatherjacket fish.\nLeatherjackets can be found year-round and most are active during rising tides and in low light conditions, i.e., early in the morning and just before sunrise. Many also feed actively throughout the day and night, but that is also dependent on tidal movements.\nSo if you\u2019re into fishing at night, take the tidal movements into consideration before going out.\nPlace the leatherjacket fish on a clean surface and use a sharp filleting knife to make an incision behind the spike and cut through the backbone till you hit the soft flesh. Do not slice off the head with the knife.\nHold the head in one hand and steady the body with the other and rip downwards to remove the head, taking the guts with it.\nMake a small cut in the skin on top of the fish where you made the first cut so you can grab onto the skin.\nPeel the skin towards the tail. This should come off easily.\nTake a fillet off either side if the leatherjacket is large enough or cook the cleaned fish whole if it is a small one.\nChop the cleaned leatherjacket into 4 pieces.\nMake a marinade by mixing 10 tablespoons of soy sauce with 6 tablespoons of mirin, 2 cloves of grated garlic, 3 tablespoons of grated ginger, 2 pinches of white pepper, a pinch of salt, 1 teaspoon of white sugar and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil.\nPour the marinade over the fish and coat evenly.\nCover and refrigerate for half an hour.\nRemove the fish from the refrigerator and toss in plain flour to coat evenly.\nHeat 2 cups of vegetable oil in a deep frying pan and fry the fish in batches till golden brown and cooked through.\nServe with lime wedges and green salad.\nListen to Why You Need to STOP Eating Fresh Fish on the Cast & Spear Podcast\nQ: Do leatherjackets have scales?\nA: Yes, but they are so tiny that you wouldn\u2019t know it.

The call was to build upon this new coalition\u2019s first year of work together, and plans for the future. Resistance to the proposed carbon pipelines has been and will continue to be a focus of the Rebellion.\nDuring the community call I learned about a new report from the Oakland Institute titled The Great Carbon Boondoggle, which focuses on the resistance to Summit\u2019s carbon pipeline here in the Midwest. The Introduction to the report was the subject of yesterday\u2019s blog post: Buffalo Rebellion Community Call: Carbon Pipeline Resistance.\nThe next part of the report is FALSE PROMISES & HARASSMENT OF LANDOWNERS.\nWho owns the land?\nBefore getting into that, we must continue to raise awareness about who owns the land. There is a long and complex history of ways Indigenous peoples globally were forced to cede (give up power or territory) their lands to settler colonists. There is a growing movement to return lands to native peoples. #LANDBACK\nSettler colonialism is a structure that perpetuates the elimination of Indigenous people and cultures to replace them with a settler society.[1][2] Some, but not all, scholars argue that settler colonialism is inherently genocidal.[3] It may be enacted by a variety of means ranging from violent depopulation of the previous inhabitants to less deadly means such as assimilation or recognition of Indigenous identity within a colonial framework.[4]\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settler_colonialism\nFor the purposes of discussions related to pipelines now, landowner refers to those with legal title within the colonial framework of this country.

"to write in/draw on, so it felt like making a book. I was hooked. I\u2019ve really only ever wanted to be a writer, so then I was stuck with two questions. What was I going to do to support myself financially while writing, and what kind of writing did I want to do?\nWe hear you\u2019re a hiker extraordinaire. Do you go to all the places you write about in your books?\nRebecca: I love when books feel rooted in a sense of place, like they have to take place where and when they do and wouldn\u2019t be the same book if written any other way. The setting connects to so many senses. It also shapes what the characters do and experience and what conflicts or complications arise. I rely on my own experiences to convey the overall feel of a place as well as specific details that make it come alive.\nSo tell us about your setting research for MAKE ME BEG.\nRebecca: MAKE ME BEG and the Men of Gold Mountain series overall is set in the north Cascade Mountains in Washington State. I went there specifically to check it out as a place to set a series. I wanted to create a small ski town at the center of the books and use Mt. Baker as my model. The world of Gold Mountain is made up, but I couldn\u2019t have done it without drawing on the hiking trip I took to explore the area.\nYou were born in Boston. Did you grow up there? How did this early life experience affect who you are today?\nRebecca: I was born just outside Boston and grew up there; my parents still live in the same house we moved to when I was two. As an adult I can appreciate what an idyllic place it is to live\u2014tree-lined streets; very walkable; close to the city as well as mountains, beaches, lakes and farmland; a good school system, and lots of amenities. But, like a lot of kids, I just wanted to travel, see the world as soon as I could strike out on my own.\nA birdie told us you took a gap year after high school.\nRebecca: And I traveled to India, with a few clothes in a backpack and not a whole lot of plans.

"ical combinatory logic\u201d. Even more simply, it uses rewrite rules to evaluate terms in the context of a stack. It does things like pushing a term to the stack, replacing the current term with the term on top of the stack, and popping the stack. Reduction of terms follows rules much like those in our \u03bb-calculus, where we perform applications when we can. The most important feature at such a low level is to avoid name clashes, which there are rules for as well.\nThis kind of low-level CAM code, once optimized, can then be transformed into typical machine code and run on a real computer with a real stack, and real registers to hold the terms. Even coming from a very different viewpoint, theoretically, it\u2019s still possible and desirable to run your code on a real machine! CAMs act as the intermediary between categories/\u03bb-calculi and a real machine, and are thus a valuable model in kind of the same way Turing machines are valuable even if we can\u2019t ever build one directly.\nThis is all just to say that \u201cOCaml\u201d is one of the most jam-packed acronyms I\u2019ve ever come across, and we haven\u2019t even touched the \u201cObjective\u201d part yet! Like its fellow languages in the ML family, you can interpret it on a low-ish level via lambda calculus, or you can just use it as a programming language and never worry about what\u2019s going on under the hood at all (but that\u2019s no fun)! Even though CAMs are used in real applications (namely, the creation of Caml) it can\u2019t hurt to try on a new way of thinking, and because CAMs provide a different model of thinking about how computers operate, they\u2019re valuable in and of themselves.\nReal World OCaml.

"say upon an eternal problem. The whole question is whether he has.\nOn \u201cPickwick Papers:\u201d\nSam Weller is the great symbol in English literature of the populace peculiar to England. His incessant stream of sane nonsense is a wonderful achievement of Dickens: but it is no great falsification of the incessant stream of sane nonsense as it really exists among the English poor. The English poor live in an atmosphere of humour; they think in humour. Irony is the very air that they breathe. A joke comes suddenly from time to time into the head of a politician or a gentleman, and then as a rule he makes the most of it; but when a serious word comes into the mind of a coster it is almost as startling as a joke. The word \u201cchaff\u201d was, I suppose, originally applied to badinage to express its barren and unsustaining character; but to the English poor chaff is as sustaining as grain. The phrase that leaps to their lips is the ironical phrase. I remember once being driven in a hansom cab down a street that turned out to be a cul de sac, and brought us bang up against a wall. The driver and I simultaneously said something.

The spell of Niagara is still upon and around you. You glance again and again at the white veil which thickens or grows dim beyond the leafy forest: the rush of the nearer rapids, the din of falling waters, the murmur of the echoes answering the pulsations of the descending mass, fill your ears, and pervade all nature.\nEverything around and about you appears to reply to the cataract, and to partake of it, none more so than the evergreen forest, which is bathed from year to year in the dew of the river. These noble trees, as they tower aloft on the soil, are sustained from youth to age by the invigorating spray of the mighty Falls. Their leaves are steeped, summer after summer, in the heavy dew; their trunks echo the falling waters, from the day they rise from the sod, to that in which\nthey are shaken to the ground; and the fibres of the huge moss-grown trunk on which you sit, prostrate and mouldering on the rich soil beneath, bedded in the fresh grass and leaves, still vibrates to the sound of its thunders, and crumbles gradually to dust.

While other games and virtual worlds offer user-generated content, what makes City of Heroes unique is that it has created a system that allows players to design their own missions and story-arcs within the game, and to offer those to other users (see the video here). The best-rated and most downloaded missions give \"influence\" to the player (the in-game currencies). An interesting feature of the new content-creation system is that it has been implemented as a \"game-within-a-game\" concept. A new in-game company in the Paragon Isles called Architect Entertainment sells heroes and villains virtual world subscriptions so that they can create their own missions. Simulations making simulations, Baudrillard would be proud.\nThe second thing that crossed my mind when I read about this innovation was to consider the many legal angles that this development unleashes (the first thought was that perhaps it was time to dust-off the spandex suit and don the cape once more, but I digress). City of Heroes, like most other MMOGs, claims ownership over all content created by users, and this is no exception. The CoH end user agreement states:\n\"(c) Customer content.

The past two years have seen a flurry of new laws, plans, and agreements passed with great fanfare by the government to address China\u2019s severe and growing pollution levels. However, the new enforcement mechanisms established by these policies have lacked immediately discernible impact. Instead, the signing of the Paris Agreement and promulgation of the most environmentally friendly Five-Year Plan notwithstanding, China experienced new, high-profile environmental disasters that clouded an already troubled legacy.\nIn November 2016, Tianjin courts announced that they would jail forty-nine individuals in connection with the massive explosions that rocked the city in August 2015 and killed at least 173 people. Managers and employees of the chemical warehouse responsible for the blast were given hefty sentences alongside twenty-five government officials accused of accepting bribes and dereliction of duty.\nPublic fury over the Tianjin disaster, however, appears to have had little impact in preventing similar disasters from occurring; according to government"

"\nLogically and reasonably, I knew it wasn\u2019t worth getting upset over because it literally still was the happiest day of my life. But, I think the fatigue and shock set in and I couldn\u2019t help but tear up when I realised I wasn\u2019t going to get to wear it. Haffsah was in the bridal suite with me and did such an amazing job to ensure I was okay, alongside my best friends. After a brief pep talk, she touched up my makeup and worked with my family to devise a solution. She was so calm and such a gem to work with, even in such a stressful situation.\u201d\nThankfully, both bride and groom had no such challenges on the wedding day or during any other day as well.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we faced any real challenges, although there were some moments which took it out of us a bit. There was quite a bit of work required around the logistics of the events, particularly since half of our guests were traveling from New South Wales, including Cheten himself. We scheduled all our events to make sure it was as easy as possible for people to travel down to Melbourne. Cheten and his entire family actually traveled from Wollongong down to Melbourne on a coach on the day of the Sangeet!\n\u201cApart from that, the only other real challenge was moving our outdoor wedding to indoors. I knew that rain was a possibility, but I really didn\u2019t believe that it would rain in the middle of summer! Cheten calmly reminded me that all that matters is that we get married surrounded by the people we love, and he was totally right, it didn\u2019t even matter in the end! I was the happiest person in the world. Ultimately we had strong support from both sets of parents which made everything so easy. We couldn\u2019t have asked for more because all they wanted was for us, was to be happy.\u201d\nOn drawing inspiration for her own wedding look, Nomeeta was quite alternative in her style, opting for unique designer wear that wasn\u2019t so common.\n\u201cI did a lot of research on social media to figure out what kind of looks I wanted to go for.

"historically, the report lays out one of the problems faced by today\u2019s pharmecutical firms:\nIn a classic Catch-22 situation, the more effective companies were at developing such mass market blockbusters, the more effective they needed to be in developing even larger revenue replacements, as patents on existing products expired and markets were lost to generics.\nR&D budgets have greatly increased since the late 1990s. \"However, massive scale has not increased R&D productivity. FDA approvals of New Molecular Entities have at best remained steady, with only a handful of these approvals being truly innovative, first-inclass molecules. Despite recent attempts at outsourcing and other modes of increasing effeciency, results have been mixed, and a more \u201cfundamental shift in the industry\u2019s operating environment is under way.\"\nYet, while individual companies have achieved performance improvements in different aspects of R&D, no signi\ufb01cant industry-wide gain is evident.\nPhenotyping of diseases is being replaced by an understanding of disease at the molecular level. Segmentation of patients based on observable characteristics is being replaced by segmentation based on genotype (with efficacy assessed by related biomarkers). This change cannot be underestimated, Deloitte says.\nTechnological advances are increasingly providing companies the opportunity to link treatments and ef\ufb01cacy to genetically homogeneous patient groups.\nWhile typical blockbuster ef\ufb01cacy rates range from 35 - 75 percent, genotyped market segments and biomarker-assessed responses promise treatments with signi\ufb01cantly higher ef\ufb01cacy rates, possibly approaching 100 percent.\nA critical determinant of financial success for these new entrants will be ownership of the genotype\u2013biomarker combination that identifies high-efficacy treatments for a particular patient\u2013disease state.

You, or the person doing the carotid hold is supposed to be very alert to the feeling of the subject going limp - in marital art they tap, however, you can not depend on that, so one must watch.\nIf you continue to hold for two minutes while the person is unconscious then that is the legal precedent of time designated for an intention to kill.\nPremediation doesn't come into this so don't get other factors involved, please.\nCriminal attorneys do not need to know anything about marital arts, choke holds or carotid holds to the best of my knowledge. However, a marital arts instructor needs to know exactly what they are teaching and has the responsibility of being certain pupils are properly trained.\nOfficials, judges, referees, coaches, trainers can recognize the player when he/she is choked out (becomes unconscious).\nHowever, sadly, perhaps because they are not properly trained, law enforcement officers use of neck holds (as they call them) has resulted in deaths. They need to be properly trained by judo certified instructors since the misuse and abuse of this technique of choking when used improperly results in fatalities.\nThere have been reports of deaths allegedly caused by the use of choke holds which led to class action suits against its use from local to state to the US Supreme Court.\nMitchell (civil rights attorney) argued before the Supreme Court in 1983 that police officers 'regularly and routinely' applied charotid holds in situations where they were not threatened by the use of deadly force and that numerous people have been killed or injured as a result of the application of the carotid hold and other choke holds.\nHe didn't win, but California made it a deadly force option, same as a gun.

What a small world.\nKleine Sheidegg was just like I imagined it from Allan\u2019s The Summer of Arnie Trout: the terrace, the coloured umbrellas and the imposing North face of the Eiger.\nThe tunnels that we passed through were made over a century ago with basic technology (pick axes and dynamite). They were so well thought out. Visitors were led to all the different vantage points with people exiting on one side of the elevator and others entering from the other, going through ice tunnels and rock tunnels.\nOf course the whole mountain range was impressive. The Eiger, the Jungfrau and the Monch are the main summits of the Bernese Alps and are the most distinctive sights in Switzerland. At 4158 meters we were at the Top of Europe.\nWe got little tidbits of information about the mountains on the way down. For instance, the speed record for a solo climber up the North Face of the Eiger is 2 hours and 28 minutes, held by Dani Arnold, a Swiss Alpine climber. That is 3970 meters! Usually the climb takes between 1-3 days and is extremely dangerous due to rock falls, avalanches and falling ice. Ay! He was literally running up that mountain. I was short of breath just standing there at that altitude.\nOn the way down, we decided to stop at the Wengernalp station. We had a picnic just below the daunting Hundschopf on the Lauberhorn, the longest downhill on the World Cup circuit. Just imagining racers flying off this drop was frightening.\nHe pointed out another section of the run where the racers would make a sharp turn and go through a small tunnel under the train. Sounded like a death trap to me.\nWe thought we would walk down to the next station. It was only 45 minutes, the sign said. It forgot to say that it was straight down. Our thighs and knees were shot!

"previously shown that the proliferative index (PI), as determined by flow cytometry of luteinized granulosa cells obtained at oocyte retrieval, is greater in ovulation induction regimens which include the GnRH analog (GnRH-a) leuprolide acetate than those using human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) only. Specific growth factors or intrafollicular hormones may contribute to this leuprolide acetate-induced difference in cell cycle kinetics. We examined whether differences in the PI of these granulosa cells are associated with the alterations of follicular fluid content of Mullerian-inhibiting substance (MIS) and other intrafollicular hormones including FSH, estradiol, progesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone. The control group consisted of follicular fluid obtained from 18 follicles from 4 women receiving hMG alone. The GnRH-a treated group consisted of follicular fluids obtained from 55 follicles aspirated from 18 women receiving GnRH-a in addition to hMG. One-way analysis of variance using log-transformed data and expressed as geometric means with 95% confidence intervals, demonstrated that the follicles from the control group had a significant 14-fold higher concentration of 2.46 ng/mL MIS, 95% CI (1.8-4.8) vs. 0.18 ng/mL, 95% CI (0.13-0.24) P < 0.0005, a 3-fold higher concentration of 17.55 nmol/L androstenedione, 95% CI (14.6-20.9) vs. 5.76 nmol/L, 95% CI (3.1-10.5) P < 0.02, and a 1.5-fold higher concentration of 29.43 nmol/L testosterone 95% CI (22.5-38.14) vs. 19.3 nmol/"

"By Chris Davies/Sept. 5, 2015 1:48 pm EST\nUber has fixed a gaping privacy hole which left ride details for some passengers visible in Google searches, with full address information available even months after the journey. The glitch was a side-effect of Uber's \"Share my ETA\" feature, launched in 2013, which allows users to show others the progress of their trip.\nAfter choosing \"Share my ETA\" in the Uber app, the user would get a shareable link that opened up a map of the journey, the final destination and how long it would take to reach it, and information on the driver themselves.\nAlthough Uber intended the feature to be used to give real-time notifications of the progress of someone's ride, the information in the links was sticking around long after the journey had been completed.\nIf the rider posted the link somewhere publicly, search engines like Google would index the ETA data. A search for \"trip.uber.com\" turned up many results, each of which had pickup and destination address, the route traveled, the driver's name, car, and rating, and the name of the rider.\nLuckily for Uber, credit card details used to pay for the trip were not part of the data.\nNow, Uber tells Business Insider, \"Share my ETA\" links will be set to expire 48 hours after they are generated. Any publicly available pages still in existence have also been wiped.\nIt's worth noting, however, that the source code of the ETA page does include origin address information, though that location isn't visible on the page itself.

"a bit of a reputation for being cheap but this relatively unbattered example feels solid enough. Both of the rifles disassemble in much the same way with the butt assembly being removed to allow the bolt to be pulled out of the rear.\nMost notable about the CETME\u2019s bolt is the long rod protruding out the back of the bolt assembly.

"ric Crisologo, the song is an acoustic ballad that chronicles Isis' struggles with complacency, depression, & writer's block:\n\u201cI wrote \"4leaf clover\" when I was in a creatively depleted place.

I wrote this to get out of that reality and get out of my head.\"\nThe track and video both showcase why Isis is such a promising talent.

"11 and the increasing ethnic diversity of its student body by adopting a secular character education program to instruct children in universal values rather than religious doctrine. In a series of poignant interviews, the school's students articulate a clear understanding that while 9/11 left deep wounds on their community, it also created a valuable opportunity to teach the nation about Islam. The rich ethnographies in this volume link 9/11 and its effects to the experiences of a group that was struggling to be included in the American mainstream long before that fateful day. Many Muslim communities never had a chance to tell their stories after September 11. In Being and Belonging, they get that chance.\nVirginia Tibbs-Brelje\nGallaudet University Press, 1986\nLibrary of Congress PZ7.S4294Be 1986\n\"A 1987 Outstanding Book for Young Adults\" --University of Iowa Poll \"Gustie Blaine is 15 when she contracts meningitis.

"\u226585; (2) unintentional weight loss (6 kg during the last 6 months or 3 kg during the last month); or (3) a BMI between 18.5 and 20 with age <85, and between 24 and 26 with age \u226585 in combination with no nutritional intake for 3 days or reduced intake for more than 10 days (Meijers et al. 2009). If any one of these three criteria could be confirmed, the patient was diagnosed as malnourished (Halfens et al. 2006).\nStatistical Analyses Descriptive statistics were calculated for the patients and the wards. Bivariate correlations were examined to check for particularly high intercorrelations. Univariate associa- tions between the different variables were examined using SPSS 12.0.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL; ANOVAs, t-tests, Pear- son\u2019s correlation, and Chi-square test). Multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed using the Glimmix procedure in SAS for Windows V8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) with patients (level 1) nested within institutions (level 2) to explore associations between organizational culture, team climate, and preventive quality management at ward level on the one hand and the prevalence of pressure ulcers on the other. It was hard to attain a good estimate of the random ward effect due to the small number of wards per institution. The random effect was therefore distributed to the level of the institution. Since we were interested in the effect of each of our variables of interest separately (culture, team climate, and quality management), we used separate models with one of these variables at a time. The four types\nof organizational culture could not be examined together within a single model as the scores were not independent. Seven separate models were thus created for the prevalence of pressure ulcers: four models for the four organizational cultures, one for the dominant organizational culture, one for the team climate and, finally, one for preventive qual- ity management at ward level. In each model, the effects of patient age, malnutrition, and type of ward were con- trolled for. Adjusted"

"s game against the Twins, but manager Tony La Russa said he\u2019ll be reinstated within the next few days \u2014 perhaps as soon as tomorrow (via Daryl Van Schouwen of the Chicago Sun-Times).\nJim\u00e9nez\u2019s impending return should be a boon for a lineup that has underwhelmed this season. The defending AL Central winners entered the year with one of the league\u2019s more imposing rosters, but they carry a 38-40 record into play Tuesday night. Offensive struggles have been a key reason, as Chicago hitters carry a .254/.309/.377 line as a unit. They\u2019re 19th in MLB in on-base percentage and 23rd in slugging output, while their 98 wRC+ indicates they\u2019ve been two percentage points worse than a league average offense. That places them 20th leaguewide.\nLeft field has been one of a handful of problem areas, as the Sox have received a meager .250/.292/.387 showing out of the position. Jim\u00e9nez contributed to that somewhat with a rough 11 games to start the season, but the bigger factor has been a down year from Spring Training acquisition AJ Pollock. The veteran outfielder did have a decent June after a dismal first two months of his White Sox\u2019s tenure, and Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s activation should afford Chicago the freedom to plug Pollock into right field regularly as they\u2019d intended to open the season.\nGavin Sheets has seen the bulk of the right field playing time of late. The left-hander has hit .227/.296/.372, production that has been superior to Pollock\u2019s but still below-average. He\u2019s also rated poorly in the eyes of public defensive metrics, not surprising given that he\u2019s spent the vast majority of his professional career playing first base.\nJim\u00e9nez has missed notable chunks of each of the past two seasons. He was limited to 55 games last year after rupturing his pectoral tendon during Spring Training. That delayed his debut until late July, and he had a fairly disappointing .249/.303/.437 showing during the"
"for each category. Statistical analysis (ANOVA) and a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm were applied to the texture feature to evaluate the accuracy in distinguishing (i) lesions versus normal tissue and (ii) benign versus malignant lesions.\nSkewness and kurtosis were the only TF significantly different among all the four categories (p < 0.000001). In subsets (i) and (ii), a maximum area under the curve of 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82\u20130.88) for energy and 0.86 (95% CI 0.82\u20130.89) for entropy were obtained. Using the SVM algorithm, a maximum area under the curve of 0.98 for both subsets was obtained with a maximum accuracy of 94.4% in subset (i) and 90.7% in subset (ii).\nTA in combination with ML might represent a useful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of breast imaging findings in ABUS. Applying ML techniques to TFs might be superior compared to the analysis of single TF.\nAnalysis of texture features on automated breast ultrasound can help to categorise imaging findings.\nMachine learning can be applied to texture features to categorise breast lesions.\nMachine learning performs better than the analysis of single texture features.\nIn women with dense breast tissue, the combined use of mammography and hand-held ultrasound (HHUS) in breast cancer screening boosts breast cancer detection rate with additionally detected 2\u20134 cancers per 1,000 women [1,2,3,4]. However, the use of HHUS in the screening setting remains controversial due to its inherent limitations including the lack of standardisation and the necessary level of operator experience [4, 5]. In recent years, automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) has been introduced to overcome some of HHUS limitations. ABUS provides technique standardisation via the acquisition of standardised views as well as scanning parameters and resolves the issue of operator subjectivity and variation [6]. Nevertheless, interpretation of imaging findings remains highly dependent on reader skills and experience. Standardised acquisition in terms of scanning parameters (e.g., focus, gain"
"cal Ethnography and the Power of Women's Narratives Hardback\nby Elaine J. Lawless\nFolklorist Elaine J. Lawless has devoted her career to ethnographic research with underserved groups in the American Midwest, including charismatic Pentecostals, clergywomen, victims of domestic violence, and displaced African Americans.\nShe has consistently focused her research on women's speech in these contexts and has developed a new approach to ethnographic research which she calls \"reciprocal ethnography,\" while growing a detailed corpus of work on women's narrative style and expressive speech.\nReciprocal ethnography is a feminist and collaborative ethnographic approach that Lawless developed as a challenge to the reflexive turn in anthropological fieldwork and research in the 1970s, which was often male-centric, ignoring the contributions by and study of women's culture.\nCollected here for the first time are Lawless's key articles on the topics of reciprocal ethnography and women's narrative which influenced not only folklore, but also the allied fields of anthropology, sociology, performance studies, and women's and gender studies.\nLawless's methods and research continue to be critically relevant in today's global struggle for gender equality.\nPages:214 pages, 1 Tables, black and white\nPublisher:Indiana University Press\nFolklore, myths & legends\nGender studies: women\nSocial & cultural anthropology\nPaperback / softback from \u00a319.67\nPaperback / softback | Published 09/08/2019 | \u00a319.67 | View now\nThe Museum of Other People\nAdam Kuper\nThe Go-Between\nOsman Yousefzada<s> Flurstrasse 26\n13 de febrero de 2023 16:00\nThrough our dance practice, we try to build links between Swiss and South American culture.

"enior Alexis Linnebach was ready to enjoy her senior year and all the perks that come with it ever since she was a freshman.\n\u201cI was excited for all the normal stuff like spirit week, pep assemblies, and JAG. It has definitely been a major adjustment to the new normal at school.\u201d Linnebach said.\nWhen all of the coronavirus lockdown began she originally didn\u2019t think the pandemic would last into August.\n\u201cI honestly thought we were going to have a longer spring break by a week or two. I really thought the virus was only going to affect my junior year of high school. I was not expecting my senior year to be so out of the ordinary,\u201d Linnebach said.\nShe adds that back in February she was expecting to go back to school and finish on time in May just like any other regular year.\nWith the virus lasting well into the year many of the normal senior activities have been cut, leaving seniors with a bittersweet feeling regarding this year. BV West seniors have been looking forward to their long awaited last year for four years.\n\u201cI was definitely disappointed with the thought that our senior year was not going to be a typical one. It\u2019s my last year in high school and I wanted to make the most of it,\u201d Linnebach added.\nNot only has the lack of activities been disappointing for students, but the new hybrid model has been making it difficult for students to keep track of assignments or moniter the days they should be attending school. It has also taken an impact on students not just at BV West but outside school as well.\n\u201cThe school year so far has seemed like I\u2019m drinking out of a fire hydrant. Everything is completely new. With us really not being in school since March, it just feels like a ton of information is coming at you at once. It\u2019s quite overwhelming the whole situation, not just school,\u201d Linnebach said.\nWhile school has been confusing for seniors who have had three years of practice with attending classes, turning in assignments on time, balancing homework and activities, freshmen have it worse.\nFreshman year is already scary and stressful enough without the pandemic. Adding the hybrid schedule has made it much more difficult for freshmen to adjust this year.\nFreshman Regan Linnebach,"

Trading algorithms have for years tried to harness information from the weather, social media or satellites, but there\u2019s something a little demeaning about the traders themselves being exploited for data. The researchers are also arguably putting traders into a never-ending feedback loop where their actions and decisions become derivative and their notoriously lemming-like behavior amplified. If you thought the market was already driven by a herd-like mentality, this will probably make it worse \u2014 but that\u2019s also how the market works.\n\u201cEveryone on the street talks,\u201d says one trader in London (not part of the study) who said they\u2019d find such alerts about their peers\u2019 sentiment useful. \u201cThe whole part of doing what we do is discuss ideas and share information\u2026 Non-verbal communication is massive.\u201d Years back, trading floors were loud places where people would often talk on three or four phone lines at the same time; now many communicate over chat rooms and talking is minimal.\nBut the study also points to another uncomfortable phenomenon: Facial recognition is here to stay and its more controversial cousin, facial analysis, might be as well. For all the concern that has bubbled up around facial recognition, including over the mistakes it can make as a surveillance tool, tens of millions of us still use it unhesitatingly to unlock our phones.\nFacial analysis like the kind being used by Carnegie Mellon, opens a bigger can of worms. Last summer, Microsoft Corp. vowed to eliminate its facial-analysis tools, which estimated a person\u2019s gender age and emotional state, admitting that the system could be unreliable and invasive.(1) That might not matter too much for traders, eager to lap up whatever data they can for an edge. But this study \u2014 if successful \u2014 could embolden research into analyzing faces for other purposes, like assessing one\u2019s emotional state during a work meeting.\n"

"Theoretical Approach\nPhillip L. Ackerman\nWalter Schneider\nChristopher D Wickens\nExperimental and statistical methods for examining individual differences in dual-task performance and time-sharing ability are reviewed and criticized. Previous data and analysis procedures are generally inadequate to evaluate a time-sharing ability. Errors resulting from unsophisticated use of correlational and factor analytic procedures are described. Four previous studies that concern time-sharing are considered in detail. The nature of task selection, scoring methods, and control of practice and reliability issues are discussed. Based on a reanalysis of available data, a time-sharing ability is not rejected. Simulation, incorporation of theory in planning models, and crucial tests of the hypotheses are proposed as methods for assessing the time-sharing ability.\nYou can''t play twenty questions with nature and win\nA. Newell\nA contribution to the investigation of time-sharing ability*\nBranimir Sverko\n\u017deljko Jernei\u0107\nAlija Kulenovi\u0107\nInvestigated whether a distinct time-sharing factor is involved in the performance of complex tasks. Three complex tasks were used, each of which consisted of 2 simple component tasks. On each of 5 consecutive days, 51 right-handed female undergraduates performed all these tasks, both complex and simple, twice: once singly and once concurrently with an additional loading task. The performances of the 9 tasks (i.e., 3 complex and 6 simple) recorded under both conditions were intercorrelated and factor analyzed. Four factors emerged, one of which was a Time-Sharing factor. It is concluded that the Time-Sharing factor was the expression of individual differences in Ss' ability to apply an efficient strategy in responding to complex tasks.

Tidal and nontidal management efforts wereevaluated separately for both ecological and legal-institutional reasons.\nThe principal objective of this study was to determine the on-the-ground effectiveness of state CMPs inprotecting estuaries and coastal wetlands. To the extent that outcome data were available (and it wasmeager in many cases), we found that state CMPs are relatively effective and make significantcontributions to this national CZMA objective. Among the various management tools used by states,regulatory programs rated the highest for their contributions to estuary and coastal wetland protection.But a variety of other strategies and tools, many built around state-local planning partnerships, alsocontributed significantly to state accomplishments. State CMP weaknesses were also apparent,including a general lack of organized outcome monitoring; relatively limited use of restoration as amanagement strategy in many states; and relatively weak nontidal, freshwater wetland management inmany states. The principal study findings follow.\n1. The importance of estuary and coastal wetland protection is relatively high for most statesand for the nation as a whole. Based on the seven indicators used in this study, the importance of\nestuary and coastal wetland protection as a CZM issue ranges from low to high among states, but ismoderately to highly important overall. This suggests that most states would be expected to haverelatively strong, comprehensive CZM policies, processes, and institutions in place and be operatingeffectively.\n2. The potential effectiveness of state coastal management programs in protecting estuariesand coastal wetlands looks good on paper. The potential effectiveness of state CMPscollectively, based on an assessment of process indicators, was judged to be high for estuaries andtidal wetlandsthe saltwater coastbut just moderate for nontidal, freshwater wetlands.

A story of the formation of the earth in 11 parts, Supercontinent is a focused yet imaginative, mind-blowing journey through the geological record.\nSupercontinent\nSupercontinent by Thecodontion\nWhat message do you have for our readers who will be hearing Thecodotionn\u2019s all-bass death metal destruction for the first time with Supercontinent?\nG.D.: Supercontinent is very different sounding compared to Thecodontia and Jurassic. The songs are way more complex this time. We hope you enjoy its more chaotic moments and the calmer, more melodic ones equally. We are very proud of it and we think it is really unique.\nG.E.F.: Listeners who aren\u2019t familiar with us already are going to hear a rather peculiar album. Musically, it is based on opposites between darker-sounding rhythm sections and melodic, often dreamy lead parts. There is some vocal experimentation as well, we tried to maintain a \u2018narrative\u2019 approach in that sense too.\nWhat themes specifically are explored on Supercontinent? How are these themes brought to life by your bass-heavy sound?\nG.D.: As the title suggests, the record is a concept album about supercontinents, starting from the earliest one \u201cVaalbara,\u201d to the latest \u201cPangaea,\u201d which contained most of modern-day landmasses (and it is amazingly depicted on the cover artwork by Chaos Echoes\u2019 Stefan Thanneur). In a time span of a billions of years, cratons slowly drifted apart and collided with each other, and sea levels altered, forming different supercontinents over the course of time. Interludes are instead about the superoceans which surrounded them, chronologically as well (\u201cGyrosia\u201d to \u201cPanthalassa\u201d). The booming sound of the distorted bass fits the prehistoric theme of the record and we tried to convey the collisions and drifting of the continents with a more atmospheric riffing this time.

"really excited to see how players respond to it.\nA similar but slightly different question was asked by one of our Korean players.\nQ: PvP realms are getting indistinctive from the PvE realm as players are not engaging into PvP contents, since they are not finding it attractive. The only difference from the PvE realm is that it\u2019s possible to attack opponent around zones in Conflict. Is there any plan to strengthen the difference between PvP and PvE realms? \u2013 Soulcube (Korea)\nA: We don\u2019t think it\u2019s that world PvP is unattractive, we just think it\u2019s just the cumulative effect of a lot of changes we made to the game to meet other goals. For example, flying mounts are really cool and convenient, but they mean you are much less likely to stumble upon someone from the opposite faction while travelling. We considered teleportation a mandatory feature for Dungeon Finder to succeed, but then you are less likely to bump into an enemy outside of a dungeon. To get world PvP back in some form, we\u2019d have to develop something like the Isle of Quel\u2019danas: a non-flight zone that is not a sanctuary where players congregate to finish quests or earn rewards. We\u2019ll think about ways to do something like that again in the future.\nI can\u2019t say I\u2019m satisfied with the devs\u2019 answer on this one. While I agree that there\u2019s plenty of world interaction when you\u2019re out and about and questing and gathering and boosting your professions, I think that the concern of PVP players is probably more serious for them than the devs are really picking up.\nBack in the vanilla days, when mounts were both expensive and far off, and when beginner mounts were slow enough that you could still be ambushed on one successfully, it was pretty hazardous playing on a PVP server during those early levels. I remember trying to just quest as a poor level 25 Tauren Druid and getting repeatedly ganked in Stonetalon by level 60 Night Elves coming through the pass.\nAdmittedly, I moved on to play on PvE servers after that, but I understand how global combat"

The list includes an AV receiver and wireless speakers. Such a setup allows you to play music in multiple rooms, using a single sound source, such as a smartphone or tablet, and synchronizing the sound with special software.\nThere can be signal sources, including cable TV, a Blu-Ray player, or a home PC. The user can freely switch between different sound sources, and the audio can be simultaneously transmitted to several devices. For added convenience, individual devices can be combined into zones. Each of them gets its own set of sound settings and a single sound source. On the market, you will often find 2-zone receivers transmitting specific signals from different source devices to two separate rooms. For example, you can connect the Blu-ray player and TV to the same AV receiver. Therefore, with a dual zone receiver, you can watch a music concert on TV while your kids watch a Blu-ray cartoon in another room.\nHow does multi-zone work?\nThere are 3 main ways of implementing the multi-zone sound distribution feature. The most straightforward approach requires running a 7.1 channel receiver in the 5.1 channel mode for the main room. Thus, leaving additional two channels for speakers located in the second one. Some receivers have full 7.1 mode capability in the main room when the second one is not in use.\nThe second approach is when a receiver has a built-in preamplified line or lines. In this case, you need to connect it to another receiver in the second room to amplify the sound system. The control over the"

"to Reduce Indoor Noise\nJuly 20, 2021 David Son\nNoise is everywhere. It occurs when sounds from different sources clash at the same place. Unwanted sounds become noise when they start creating a negative impact on the environment and those who hear it, such as people and animals.\nWhile noise often occurs outdoors, it is present indoors too. Indeed, it is much easier to mitigate indoor noise because you can easily get to the sources of noise. However, when not controlled properly, indoor noise can cause stress and discomfort to the people exposed to it.\nBut how do you reduce indoor noise? While some people invest in sound barriers, there are other ways to mitigate unwanted sounds happening within the home or office space. These include:\nClose the windows.\nWindows welcome the air into the home or office. They also let the soundwaves in from the outdoors. If you happen to be living or working in a noisy outdoor environment, then it would be ideal to close the windows to prevent the noise from coming in.\nClosing the windows helps bar soundwaves from different sources to come into the indoor space. They significantly reduce the noise that comes from traffic jams, nearby construction sites, and other sources.\nAt the same time, when you are into playing loud music, it also helps to keep the windows closed. Keeping the windows closed prevents the sound waves from being heard by neighbours, who may interpret it as noise.\nInvest in insulation.\nAnother way to reduce noise indoors is by investing in insulation. Insulating the walls not only keeps your rooms safe from electrocution and other related accidents; they also become more sound-absorbent.\nIndoor walls are usually made of concrete. This material may be dense, but it is not fully capable of absorbing soundwaves. By insulating the walls, they become capable of absorbing specific sonic attributes, such as echo and reverb. Mitigating the effect of these attributes likewise make the sounds less annoying to the ears.\nDo wall-to-wall carpeting.\nAside from investing in insulation, wall-to-wall carpeting also significantly diminishes the effect of indoor noise. Carpeting also has strong sound absorption effects, so the impact of noise is"

And I guess also like how much of the order activity feels consistent with like actual demand trends.\nYeah. It's a good question. I mean, -- So a couple of things. One is when we think about the nature of most IDEX products, it's highly configured, some ways customized for each application.\nAnd so typically, it's not a great product to overorder lots up because you're never quite sure of how it's going to run out when the customer system. I would say what is a little different as we go through the year here in terms of typical patterns, it's just lengthening of sort of order horizon. So if somebody would have before given us, let's say, six months' worth of requirements, they might throw another quarter in there, recognizing, hey, this is a standard product. We know we're going to use it in this particular case, and we don't want to lose a place in line.\nThat tracks actually with our own lead times as we extended those lead times, most equations would work and say then that's how you would change your order patterns to accommodate it. So I really -- we've never seen a tremendous run-up of inventory IDEX material. Our distributors and channel within FMT doesn't really work that way.

"Approaches\u201d\nThere is significant excitement about the promise of natural language processing. This has been prompted by the development of transformer models for GPT-3 by OpenAI and Qingyuan CPM by BAAI/Tsinghua. These models can generate text which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from those written by humans. Apart from massively beneficial applications, the authors of GPT-3 also called for research on risk mitigation on issues such as misinformation, spam, and phishing.\nAnother development I am excited about is Bayesian approaches, which might offer advantages over deep learning in the longer-term. For example, probabilistic programming languages (PPL) systems can be provided with prior knowledge about subjects such as physics and linguistics so that they can learn faster. They can also be safer because they calibrate uncertainty and can better detect distributional shift. In other words, this can help ensure that AI systems reliably function as intended and possible risks are mitigated. Logic and probability are ancient, foundational disciplines whose unification holds significant potential for the field of AI. However, many Bayesian models do not currently work well for most applications, so PPLs could also remain more of a niche research area that would only see the payoff in research investment over the timescale of decades.\nThe Biggest Challenge in the Field of AI: \u201cNext-Generation Paradigm of Deep Learning\u201d\nThe biggest challenge is finding a next-generation paradigm of deep learning, which should be safer, more robust, and more interpretable than the current paradigm. There are now more than 1,000 incident reports related to the use of AI systems, broadly defined. The most obvious symptom for the insufficiency of deep learning is adversarial examples.\nMore fundamentally, the majority of AI research is based on the oversimplified idea that there is a fixed, known objective to be optimized. For example, in standard deep learning we define a loss function that fixes the cost of making each type of error. This and other optimisation practices have led to well-observed flaws such as Google\u2019s algorithm classifying a person as a gorilla, social media platforms optimising for click-through rate, increased safety risks for food delivery service workers, self-driving car acc"

"expertise to quickly monetize and scale the business.\n\"I am particularly pleased to be working with this incredibly strong consortium of visionary investors who have highly relevant portfolio expertise that can be leveraged to grow WellTok and the Caf\u00c3\u00a9Well platform,\" said Jeff Margolis . \"We are addressing the significant challenges consumers face as they try to optimize their own health in partnership with their plans and providers, and have built new support structures that combine the best in purpose-driven social, community, personalization and gaming technologies.\"\nSince its commercial launch in late 2011, WellTok's Caf\u00c3\u00a9Well social health network has become the leading platform for health plans and other population managers, with two of the nation's five largest health plan organizations among its customers. The company is currently contracted to serve nearly 10 million consumers on its flagship Caf\u00c3\u00a9Well platform, and is looking to sign its tenth customer in the coming months. Privacy, anonymity and security are fundamental to Caf\u00c3\u00a9Well and WellTok is HITRUST CSF Certified.\nThrough its personalized tools, compelling content, gaming/incentive platform and vibrant community, Caf\u00c3\u00a9Well's ability to provide a fun and rewarding health experience for consumers has resulted in engagement rates above 400% of industry average. Health plan members in these programs average 50 minutes per month on the site with a third participating in over 30 Caf\u00c3\u00a9Well engagement activities. Return on investment is rapid, as consumer brand affinity toward the population manager increases along with healthy activities. For example, members of two pedometer-based Caf\u00c3\u00a9Well programs have walked 5 billion steps in the last 18 months.\nOne of the innovative health plans to roll out the Caf\u00c3\u00a9Well platform is Coventry HealthAmerica, where David Fields is the chief executive officer. Fields commented, \"Based on the health improvements and member engagement in our Race to the Moon\u2122 wellness challenge, we are looking to expand the use of Caf\u00c3\u00a9Well for chronic conditions, care management and quality improvement, furthering Coventry HealthAmerica's leadership in serving its employers and members.\"\nWellTok's Social Health Management\u00c2\u00ae platform"
"heard.\nI think it\u2019s important you\u2019re aware that we\u2019ve had conversations with Joe and his team about some of the content in his show, including his history of using some racially insensitive language. Following these discussions and his own reflections, he chose to remove a number of episodes from Spotify. He also issued his own apology over the weekend.\nWhile I strongly condemn what Joe has said and I agree with his decision to remove past episodes from our platform, I realize some will want more. And I want to make one point very clear \u2013 I do not believe that silencing Joe is the answer. We should have clear lines around content and take action when they are crossed, but canceling voices is a slippery slope. Looking at the issue more broadly, it\u2019s critical thinking and open debate that powers real and necessary progress.\nAnother criticism that I continue to hear from many of you is that it\u2019s not just about The Joe Rogan Experience on Spotify; it comes down to our direct relationship with him. In last week\u2019s Town Hall, I outlined to you that we are not the publisher of JRE. But perception due to our exclusive license implies otherwise. So I\u2019ve been wrestling with how this perception squares with our values.\nIf we believe in having an open platform as a core value of the company, then we must also believe in elevating all types of creators, including those from underrepresented communities and a diversity of backgrounds. We\u2019ve been doing a great deal of work in this area already but I think we can do even more. So I am committing to an incremental investment of $100 million for the licensing, development, and marketing of music (artists and songwriters) and audio content from historically marginalized groups. This will dramatically increase our efforts in these areas. While some might want us to pursue a different path, I believe that more speech on more issues can be highly effective in improving the status quo and enhancing the conversation altogether.\nI deeply regret that you are carrying so much of this burden. I also want to be transparent in setting the expectation that in order to achieve our goal of becoming the global audio platform, these kinds of disputes will be inevitable. For me, I come back to centering on our mission of"

It isn't definitive, but it is common.

If there were a couple more motivations by character and/or some things to barter (or possibly, more obvious things to barter, since presumably there is a need to ally with other characters to more easily achieve some of those goals.), it would be closer to what I was imagining.\nBlack Leaf said:\nYou may be right about no formal rules existing for that, but it does make me wonder what assumed rules there were.\nI do get fixated on the initiative thing a bit more than other stuff, however. Mostly that's because I want to figure out a way for players to mostly handle stuff themselves with minimal Referee intervention, but also keep things moving.\nI have gotten some advice from people even just running two-sided, but many player wargames that a big functional goal is to get as many people as possible doing stuff at the same time, in order to keep events popping along.\nEdited to add:\nSo, not sure what Wesley does these days with Braunstein 4 ( Banania) , but apparently, from that video linked upthread, multiple versions of the rules exist, and there appears to be different versions of the characters in different versions of Braunstein 1 (Napoleonic).\nSo, like, that isn't confusing or anything.\nOTOH, these also weren't commercial products and they were made for a group of friends, and friends specifically who stuck around after a group of more \"gaming iz serious bizness\" type players schism'ed off.\nThe video does seem pretty clear that even in the original play of B1, the players themselves started to"

Age: 27 *signed with Dolphins*\nKnowshon Moreno has experienced a career revival in the Peyton Manning led Broncos offense. The former first round bust is a solid do it all running back. His emergence was vital to the team as it gave them a sustaining rushing attack to pair with Manning. Moreno is unlikely to break the bank, but he could be a good addition to a team in need of a lead back.\n2) Maurice Jones-Drew, Jacksonville Jaguars. Age: 29 *signed with Raiders*\nCall this a hunch. MJD had an uninspiring season with the Jaguars, but it was not all his fault. His offensive line was unable to open up holes at all this season. Injuries and personnel moves destroyed a unit that came in as Pro Football Focus\u2019 worst run blocking line. Perhaps the former league rushing titlist can be effective in a new home.\nSolid Contributors\n1) Joqiue Bell, Detroit Lions. Age: 28 (RFA) *re-signed with Lions*\nBell\u2019s restricted status is unfortunate. Given how important he was to the Lion\u2019s offense this season, its very likely he gets hit with a high tender. Bell is a big back that is a strong contributor in the passing game. If he were a UFA, he might be the prize of the market. As it stands, he will only switch teams if the Lions foolishly low-ball his tender.\n2) Donald Brown, Indianaplois Colts. Age: 27 *signed with Chargers*\nDonald Brown was another first rounder who experienced a surge in 2013. He leapfrogged Trent Richardson on the depth chart, and was a big factor for the Colts down the stretch. Brown has good vision, nice hands, and is shifty in the open field.\n3) R"

"can the student make progress on the path to knowledge. The Zen story \u2018A cup of tea\u2019 illustrates this nicely:\nNan-in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era (1868-1912), received a university professor who came to inquire about Zen.\nNan-in served tea. He poured his visitor\u2019s cup full, and then kept on pouring.\nThe professor watched the overflow until he no longer could restrain himself: \u201cIt is overfull. No more will go in!\u201d\n\u201cLike this cup,\u201d Nan-in said, \u201cyou are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?\u201d\nAlthough many of those whom Socrates challenges get no further than recognising their preconceptions, Socrates would see this as a boon, for now the ground is prepared for the journey to continue.\nPerhaps Euthyphro, a religious \u2018expert\u2019 who has taken his own father to court on a charge of impiety, does not get even as far as this: by the end of the dialogue named after him he is repeating himself and seems incapable of seeing the implications of Socrates\u2019 questions. His mind has been numbed in the manner noted by the playboy-general Alcibiades, who compares Socrates\u2019 questions to the numbing effect of a stingray\u2019s barbs (Meno, 80a). Most of those to whom Socrates talks end up feeling numb and at a loss, unsure how to continue. This state has been termed \u2018aporia\u2019 (\u2018impasse\u2019) and Socrates sees reaching it as a vital part of his method. His skill as a framer of questions now comes to the fore, as he guides his interlocutor on to the next stage, towards knowledge \u2013 a stage which generally has very limited success!\nA famous Zen parable which illustrates the importance of the search is \u2018The sound of one hand clapping\u2019.

Some folks forget it was Criterion's laserdisc releases that first really took advantage of that format and brought to light the ideas of bonus material and audio commentaries.\nOn Location in Morocco - Scorsese himself shot some handheld VHS footage of the filming. While I have no idea why they transcoded and uprezzed this to HD (just a higher SD bitrate would have been fine) but this is a fun 15 minutes.

Then, by looking at RT5 and RT7's external advertisements, router RT1 can decide between RT5 or RT7 when sending to a destination in another Autonomous System (one of the networks N12-N15).\nNote that a failure of the line between routers RT6 and RT10 will cause the backbone to become disconnected. Configuring another virtual link between routers RT7 and RT10 will give the backbone more connectivity and more resistance to such failures. Also, a virtual link between RT7 and RT10 would allow a much shorter path between the third area (containing N9) and the router RT7, which is advertising a good route to external network N12.\n3.5 IP subnetting support\nOSPF attaches an IP address mask to each advertised route. The mask indicates the range of addresses being described by the particular\nroute. For example, a summary advertisement for the destination 128.185.0.0 with a mask of 0xffff0000 actually is describing a single route to the collection of destinations 128.185.0.0 - 128.185.255.255. Similarly, host routes are always advertised with a mask of 0xffffffff, indicating the presence of only a single destination.\nIncluding the mask with each advertised destination enables the implementation of what is commonly referred to as variable-length subnet masks. This means that a single IP class A, B, or C network number can be broken up into many subnets of various sizes. For example, the network 128"

Most of the samples examined were very weak and porous although they had retained full structural integrity. With the exception of the 19th century sample, none of the concretes had maintained pH alkaline enough to immobilize radionuclides. Hydrated calcium silicates have been detected in some samples which are similar to those observed in modern Portland cement concretes. These stable cementitious species have endured for almost two thousand years. All the ancient concretes and mortars examined contained natural pozzolanic material or crushed burnt clay. This may have had some effect on the reduction in alkalinity although the main reason was full carbonation of calcium hydroxide\nEffect of shear span, concrete strength and strrup spacing on behavior of pre-stressed concrete beams\nAhmad, S.; Bukhari, I.A.\nThe shear strength of pre-stressed concrete beams is one of the most important factors to be considered in their design. The available data on shear behavior of pre-tensioned prestressed concrete beams is very limited. In this experimental study, pre-tensioned prestressed concrete I-beams are fabricated with normal and high- strength concretes, varying stirrup spacing and shear span-to-depth ratios. 1Wenty one I-beam specimens that are 300 mm deep and 3745-4960mm long are tested up to failure while deflections, cracking pattern, cracking and failure loads were recorded. The research results are compared with ACI 318-02 and Structure Analysis Program, Response 2000. It was observed that with the decrease in concrete strength, failure mode of prestressed concrete beams changes from flexure shear to web shear cracking for values of shear span-to-depth ratio less than 4.75. Increase in stirrup spacing decreased the effectiveness of stirrups in transmitting shear across crack as a result of which failure mode is changed to web shear cracking especially for beams with lower values of she"

Moreover, he commanded the Priests, that at the time of their ministry they should continue in holiness, and should not know their wives. And also concerning Elijah it is thus written, that at one time he dwelt in Mount Carmel, and at another he dwelt at the brook Cherith, and was ministered to by his disciple; and because his heart was in heaven, the bird of heaven used to bring sustenance to him; and because he took upon him the likeness of the angels of heaven, those very angels brought him bread and water when he was fleeing from before Jezebel. [893]And because he set all his thought in heaven, he was caught up in the chariot of fire to heaven, [894] and there his dwelling-place was established for ever. Elisha also walked in the footsteps of his Master. He used to dwell in the upper chamber of the Shunamite, and was ministered to by his disciple. For thus the Shunamite said;--He is a holy Prophet of God and passes by us continually, for thus it becomes his holiness that we should make for him an upper chamber and do for him the service that is (necessary) in it. [895]Now what was the service necessary in the upper chamber of Elisha? Clearly the bed and table and stool and lamp-stand only. But what shall we say of John? He also used to dwell amongst men, and preserved his virginity honourably, and received the Spirit of God. Moreover, the blessed Apostle said concerning himself and concerning Barnabas:--Had we then not power to eat and to drink and to lead about wives with us? But it was not becoming or right. [896]\n6. Therefore, brethren, because we know and have seen that from the beginning it was through woman that the adversary had access unto men, and to the end he will accomplish it by her--for she is the weapon of Satan, and through her he fights against the champions.

The key idea is the extraction of hydrogen from water in addition to that from the hydrocarbon in an optimal fashion. This has the benefit of higher water vapor to CO2 exhaust ratio than conventional carbonaceous fuels when generating energy via combustion, a prudent step in achieving Netzero goals in a shorter time, and creating energy independence in most places.. The process of production makes concentrated CO2 available for use and or sequestration. The process also maximizes use of renewable electricity in hydrogen generation, and maximizes use of existing infrastructure, with a minimum capital cost by energy recycle in the process. The process design applies sound thermodynamic principles which evolved during the nineteenth century, and mimics the geochemical processes going on in some of the natural 'colorless hydrogen'.\nA Means to Make an Extremely Bright Entangled Source\nRemi Cornwall\nSubject: Physical Sciences, Optics Keywords: Path Entanglement; Non-heralded; Bright Entangled Source; Entanglement Purification\nThis paper discusses a means of making an extremely bright path entangled source.

"existing workflow.\nDrenik: The pandemic accelerated digital transformation, but cybersecurity has not necessarily kept up with the pace of innovation. How can organizations ensure that they are bringing new applications to the market as quickly as possible without compromising safety?\nMcKay: Security needs to be embedded into developers\u2019 workflows so that it is possible to scale without slowing the pace of innovation required in this digital-first, post-pandemic world. Finding and fixing security vulnerabilities during development (rather than after) accelerates software delivery, eliminates bottlenecks, achieves scale, and ensures that companies are building software that is more secure. One key benefit is that development teams are empowered to become more self-sufficient \u2013 embedding security into their continuous development process means they no longer have to wait for anyone else to give them the green light to keep moving fast on the road to digital transformation.\nDrenik: There is a widespread shortage of cybersecurity talent \u2013 and while no developer wants to be associated with an app that was hacked, they also do not necessarily have the desire or bandwidth to become security experts themselves. What can business leaders do to close this gap?\nMcKay: It is true that no developer wants to be associated with an app that was hacked \u2013 but, again, that is becoming more challenging for a number of reasons. Despite the rise of cyber threats, many are not taking the appropriate steps to protect themselves even as they increasingly turn to apps for more and more critical tasks in both their work and personal lives. For example, more than half of U.S. adults use their smartphones for banking, according to a Prosper Insights & Analytics Survey, but over one-quarter have not taken any steps to protect their digital/online privacy.\nProsper \u2013 Smartphone Activities \u2013 Banking\nThis means it is largely up to the software providers to provide security, but like you mentioned, there is a pervasive cybersecurity talent shortage with 3.5 million unfulfilled security jobs. The pool of skilled developers, on the other hand, is growing exponentially every day, so empowering them to build software and applications more securely is one way to help to bridge this gap.\nAs an industry, we need to equip developers with the ability to proactively address vulner"

"ceptually-motivated lossy compression scheme where the properties of the human auditory system (HAS) in order to achieve compression up to about a tenth of the original audio file size. The main idea behind MPEG audio compression and other similar perceptually-motivated audio coders is that the signal is separated into frequency bands and each frequency band is then subsequently quantized. This quantization results into artifact that can be made perceptually inaudible by taking advantage of the \"hardware\" limitations of the human ear. In order to represent musical signals for subsequent classification, segmentation, and retrieval typically features that describe the audio content are automatically calculated. The main idea behind this project, is to calculate these feature directly on the compressed audio data without having to perform a subsequent analysis after decompression. In a essence, what is happening is that the analysis using during the encoding stage when the file is compressed is used as the analysis front-end for feature extraction. This idea was independently proposed by Tzanetakis and Cook, ICASSP99 and David Pye, ICASSP99. More details can be found:\n\"Sound analysis using MPEG compressed audio\" George Tzanetakis and Perry Cook\nIn Proc. Int. Conf. Audio, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), Istanbul, Turkey, 2000\nAutomatic Musical Genre Classification George Tzanetakis and Perry Cook\nMusical Genres are labels created and used by humans to categorize music. Although their boundaries are fuzzy, members of a particular genre typically share similar characteristics. Currently, genre classification on the web is done manually. Automatic genre classification has the potential to automate this process. Perhaps, even more important, genre classification is an excellent way to test different feature sets that attempt to rerpresent musical content and this the main reason I am interested in this problem. Most of the previous work in audio and music classification that I am aware of used various types of features that essentially represent the timbral \"texture\" of the sound. These feature originate and are also applicable to other types of audio such as speech and isolated musical instrument tones. However, music has distinct characteristics that separate from other audio signals such as pitch and rhythm content. In order to represent those aspects that are unique to music, I proposed two feature sets to represent rhythm (based"

All the hills are covered with luxuriant growth of forests with nagesar, jurul, Indian rubber, tan, oak, ash, teak and palm.\nBrief History of Manipur\nManipur has population of two groups, the people who inhabit the hills called the Nagas and those who inhabit the valley called the Meiteis. The hills are also inhabited by the group called the Kukis. Imphal is the political capital of Manipur. The earliest recorded history dates to 900 AD. In the course of its history there have been several invasions from Myanmar (Burma), which borders with Manipur and numerous clashes with the Nagas.\nIn 1826, Manipur was brought into India by the treaty of Yandavo by Raja Jai Singh with the British at the end of the Indo-Burmese war. This followed a dispute in accession to the throne. With the intervention of the British the dispute was settled.\nIn 1891 Churachand was nominated the Raja and it came under British rule as a princely state. During World War II Imphal was occupied by the Japanese.

Conjugates formed between WT and Lckoff CTLs with peptide-pulsed EL4 targets were fixed and labeled with antibodies against CD8 (Fig. 3 A, white) to identify the T cell, talin (Fig. 3 A, green) to identify the peripheral SMAC (pSMAC), and \u03b3-tubulin (Fig. 3 A, red) to identify the centrosome. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye, and the position of the centrosome was classified according to whether the signal given by \u03b3-tubulin was on the distal or proximal side of the nucleus relative to the synapse or docked (i.e., in contact) with the plasma membrane marker CD8 (Fig. 3 A). All images were collected as z stacks and reconstructed using Volocity software so that they could be viewed in 3D to accurately classify the position of the centrosome relative to the synapse and the nucleus.\nThe centrosome was docked at the plasma membrane of the immune synapse in 50% of conjugates formed between F5 WT CTLs and targets. The centrosome was on the synapse-proximal side of the nucleus, but not docked, in 34% of conjugates and on the distal side of the nucleus from the synapse in the remaining 16% of conjugates (n = 112; Fig. 3, B and C; and Video 5). In Lckoff CTLs, the position of the centrosome was different. In 75% of the conjugates formed by Lckoff CTLs, the centrosome was found to be proximal to the synapse but not docked at the plasma membrane"

As your own documentation makes clear, there is no such thing any more as \"affiliate-nominated candidates\" \u2013 it is all \"community-and-affiliate-selected\" seats. Moreover, you said that this year you want to implement this new process, whereby the community can only vote for candidates pre-selected by the affiliates, on a trial basis. You say you haven't even thought about future elections, but inherent in the word \"trial\" is the notion that one is testing something to establish its suitability for future application. This is what the word \"trial\" means. It is a dry run.\nFinally, could you say why you issued your \"Call for feedback\" on 23 December 2021? Is that a good date to make sure an important issue gets maximum attention?

"12\nSystem Shock hands-on: A remake driven by respect and restraint\nIn Skyrim, much like reality, the overworld is well-explored. Over the last 10 years, inquisitive nomads have roved its rolling pastoral plains, climbed its highest hills, and plumbed the depths of its deepest holds and keeps. There isn\u2019t a nook or cranny in the whole of the dragon-ravaged realm that\u2019s yet to be uncovered. And yet in Skyrim, again much like reality, much of its oceans remain unexplored.\nThat\u2019s where Song of the Sea (opens in new tab) comes in, an in-progress player-made mod that creator Adam Lampman, otherwise known as Delta 6, bills as a \u201cmini-DLC\u201d that adds new siren-themed quests, abilities, and locations to a world you otherwise know so well. Centred around the game\u2019s Sea of Ghosts \u2013 the northern waters that divide Tamriel and Atmora \u2013 expect a character-driven storyline, the chance to morph into sirens, acquire new water-based powers, and to set up shop inside an underwater lair. \u201cI have a storyboard that\u2019s 45 pages long,\u201d says Lampman. \u201cI\u2019m aiming for about six to eight hours of content come full release.\u201d\nWater you on about\n(Image credit: Bethesda; Adam Lampman)\nSkyrim survived the decade and Bethesda believes \u201cpeople will still be playing it\u201d in the next one\nLampman says it wasn\u2019t the Sea of Ghosts and its coinciding lore that inspired him to create a mermaid mod, but instead the scope for cool water-based gameplay elements. During his most recent playthrough of Skyrim, of which there have been many, he found himself using water-based magic more than usual \u2013 leveraging the likes of Waterbreathing, an Alteration spell found in the base game that lets you breathe for longer underwater; and other mod projects such as Reynos\u2019 Fins, featured in the Apocalypse pack that lets you swim 100 percent faster for 60 seconds.\n\u201cSome part of my brain was like:"
"BODY { margin: 2em } /* all margins set to 2em */\nBODY { margin: 1em 2em } /* top & bottom = 1em, right & left = 2em */\nBODY { margin: 1em 2em 3em } /* top=1em, right=2em, bottom=3em, left=2em */\nThe 'margin' property is shorthand for setting 'margin-top', 'margin-right' 'margin-bottom' and 'margin-left' at the same place in the style sheet. These properties allow only one value. The last rule of the example above is equivalent to the example below:\nmargin-top: 1em;\nThe margins express the minimal distance between the borders of two adjacent elements. See the formatting model (section 4) for an example.\nWhen margin properties are applied to replaced elements (e.g. IMG), they express the minimal distance from the replaced element to any of the content of the parent element.\nNegative margin values will enable interesting visual effects such as overlapping text. However, they will also complicate the formatting model, and we would like to gain more implementation experience before standardizing one way or the other.\nValue: block | inline | list-item | none\nInitial: according to HTML\nThis property indicates if an element is inline (e.g. 'EM' in HTML), block-level (e.g. 'H1' in HTML), or a block-level list item (e.g. 'LI' in HTML). For HTML documents, the initial value will be taken from the HTML specification.\nA value of 'none' turns the display of the element, including children elements and the surrounding box, off.\nP { display: block }\nEM { display: inline }\nLI { display: list-item }\nIMG { display: none }\nThe last rule turns the display of images off.\nNote that HTML defines what elements are block-level (called \"Block Structuring Elements\" in [2]) and inline (called \"Phrase Markup\" in [2]), and this may be hardcoded into some UA implementations.\nValue: <length> | <percentage> | auto\nInitial: auto\nThis property can be applied to text elements, but it is most useful with inline images and"

", Hines, McAllister, Palmer, Parker, Reed, Richardson, Stoddard, Thayer, Whitcomb and Wilder.\nThe 13th VT passed most of its 90-day term of service in \u201cquiet duty\u201d -- guarding railroad properties and river crossings -- before the unit was ordered from its camp in late June 1863. As their march began, some expected the regiment was headed to Washington, DC, to board a train that would take them back home to Vermont. In fact, their regiment was being rushed to join the First Army Corps then marching into Maryland.\nWhile some in the regiment had hoped to serve out the short balance of their enlistment uneventfully, many looked forward to finally entering the shooting war.\nOn June 18, Lincoln had ordered George Meade to replace Joseph Hooker as head of the Army of the Potomac, and Meade was swiftly consolidating that army\u2019s two wings in a move northward that would keep it between General Lee\u2019s army (headed, it seemed, towards Harrisburg, PA) and the nation\u2019s capital.\nFour Waitsfield soldiers had died of disease and two had been discharged for disability before the regiment began its march on June 25.\nEdwin Palmer kept a diary throughout the march. On day one the regiment covered almost 30 miles, the final eight in steady rain. Over the next several days it moved through Centreville, Herndon Station and Guilford Station in Virginia, crossed the Monocacy River and halted briefly at Frederick, Maryland, for re-supply. Exhausted men fell by the road, to be picked up (if lucky) by a regimental supply wagon and carried forward to the next overnight resting place. Some men\u2019s shoes wore through, leaving them partially barefoot as their companies hurried along.\nAccelerating the pace, the regiment camped some two miles south of the Pennsylvania border on the night of June 30. On July 1 the 13th was rotated to the head of the march. Nearing the battlefield, it led the Second Brigade across Marsh Creek and Plum Run and camped atop Cemetery Ridge. The 13th Vermont had marched about 126 miles to arrive there."

Even while several research studies suggest that Google loves long-form content, we will never know the exact explanation.\nLong-form material, it is thought, generates more backlinks and hence ranks higher.\nLong-form content appears to be the way to go, whether it is a direct ranking indication or simply a technique to develop more linkable material.\n4. Keyword Exact Match\nWhile Google has progressed past exact-match phrases for Virginia Beach it companies and can now discern relevance beyond word strings, it is still necessary to include your target keyword.\n5. Engagement with the content\nTo my knowledge, Google has never verified that on-page interaction (what users do once they get on your page) is used as a ranking criterion.\nThere are expert hypotheses that Google employs user engagement measures as a ranking factor. Still, such signals are analyzed differently from one SERP to the next, and they are seldom absolute numbers. Instead, they are matched for top-ranking sites, enabling Google to spot any irregularities fast.\nApart from generating really valuable material, there aren\u2019t many content providers can do to influence user engagement. However, viewing site statistics and tracking content effectiveness is always smart for content providers.\u2026\nIf you live through the initial stage of fame and get past it, and remember thats not who you are.

"required to improve models and decrease uncertainties, particularly over the ocean due to the susceptibility of marine clouds to small changes in aerosol concentrations.\nThe Clear Sky payload (Figure 3) is designed to measure the direct radiative effect in the atmospheric column up to ~3 km (1.86 miles), specifically aerosol optical depth and phase function of scattered light. The Cloudy Sky payload is designed to look at the relationship between aerosol number, concentration, and particle size below and above the cloud, and cloud droplet number concentration within the cloud.\nClear Sky and Cloudy Sky payloads make measurements of aerosol and cloud properties that are needed to improve climate model simulations of the impact of aerosols on climate. Scattering and absorption of solar radiation by atmospheric aerosol particles affect Earth\u2019s radiation budget, including cooling at the Earth\u2019s surface. In addition, aerosol particles take up water and form cloud droplets which can increase cloud brightness and lead to a cooling of the Earth\u2019s surface.\nThe NOAA PSL miniFlux is a collection of complementary systems and sensors selected to provide robust and accurate measurements of atmospheric thermodynamic and kinematic states. MiniFlux (Figure 5A) carries sensors to make redundant measurements of temperature, humidity, and pressure, in addition to nadir and zenith thermal IR temperatures and sensors to provide a three-dimensional wind measurement. These measurements, combined with accurate inertial position and orientation measurements collected by the miniFlux system, enable for estimation of atmospheric energy transfer conditions.\nExample miniFlux data from the March 9, 2022 flight is shown in Figures 5B (pressures) and 5C (temperatures). All miniFlux flights were co-flown with the Clear Sky nose cone measurement payload. The level 1 data of the variety of temperature and pressure were in good agreement and all sensors performed well. Level 2 and final data with any needed quality-control and calculated variables are in process.\nA large component of forecast uncertainties results from improper model physics. Therefore, improving the representation of physical processes and ultimately, physical parameterizations, is a critical step towards better predictive skill across the weather and climate timescales.

What I don\u2019t enjoy is the inevitable follow up story about the same bright young people being denied a place in the local varsities or a scholarship by the government due to the unfair NEP. It breaks my heart but I am sure this year will be no different.\nOne thing that concerns me is the problem of low expectations among top students in Malaysia. Often, students with excellent SPM or STPM results will be content with pursuing an engineering degree with UPM or Universiti Tenaga Malaysia or some unknown institution in Malaysia. This leaves me extremely puzzled. Why shortchange yourself? For SPM students, I think some students want a short cut and an assured place in a university. This to me is myopic and short-sighted. True you are assured a place in the university but look at it this way: you are stuck with a lousy degree for the rest of your life. I have often said that a good degree doesn\u2019t mean you will do well in life but a lousy degree may keep many doors shut at the beginning of your career. Many international firms simply will not hire you if you come from an unknown institution. So my advice to SPM students, do your A-Levels or STPM and don\u2019t try to get into a third-rate university. It is simply not worth it. A case of the old adage: penny wise, pound foolish. If your results are good, try the ASEAN scholarship. In the meantime, try to improve your written and spoken English.\nFor top STPM students, please do apply to Singapore universities if you can afford it. Why sell yourself short? Singapore universities are head and shoulders above Malaysian universities. Although"

"and in various tones and with numerous actors sought for the lead from Bill Murray to Steven Seagal. But with the success of Pee Wee\u2019s Big Adventure and Beetlejuice, the studio settled on Tim Burton as a new upcoming director and fans began to buzz with interest. When Burton announced Beetlejuice star Michael Keaton as his Batman, the interested turned to outrage, though the outrage calmed down somewhat as it was also announced that film icon Jack Nicholson would be his arch-nemesis, The Joker. The film was finally made and after years of waiting, I remember enjoying it upon seeing it opening night on 6/23/89 but I had some problems with it that kept me from loving it. With a recent revisit, I found those problems still haunt it and to be honest, it is kind of dated especially with the Prince songs, which I never liked being in the film in the first place. They totally contrast and work against Danny Elfman\u2019s moody and gothic score. But I digress\u2026\nBatman opens with a mysterious bat suited figure thrashing two criminals on a rooftop and the subsequent investigation by hard-nosed reporter Alexander Knox (a completely annoying Robert Wuhl and a character that could have been totally removed without any effect on the story) and intrepid photographer Vicki Vale (a bland Kim Basinger). We also get a second storyline of mob enforcer Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) who is sleeping with crime boss Carl Grissom\u2019s (Jack Palance) girlfriend (Jerry Hall) and Grissom knows it. Grissom sends Napier on a job which is actually a set-up and when the police arrive, so does \u2018The Bat\u201d and Jack winds up shot in the face and falling in a vat of chemicals. The Joker is thus born, but so is a hero as The Batman (Michael Keaton) is secretly orphaned billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne, a man who is avenging the murder of his parents by taking the criminals of Gotham head on as his masked alter ego. And with the Joker planing to ruin Gotham, he and Batman are fated to collide. But Wayne and Joker are also"

": Report\nETC Press: Single\nETC Press: Student\nGames for Impact\nImmersive Spaces\nMobile Media\nThemed Spaces<s> Horses Playing Harps\nMay contain traces of beef\nOxford Stuff\nTokyo Police Club \u2013 Forcefield\nJust before turning the ripe old age of 25, I discovered a concept known as a mid-mid life crisis. Y\u2019know, one of those made-up millennial generation fads, this one based on the idea that you don\u2019t have to be 40 with a mortgage and kids to experience a mid-life crisis. I turned 25 and lo-and-behold, self-diagnosed myself as having a mid-mid life crisis. This generally involved being more of a shambles than usual, committing some minor criminal offenses, wanting to leave my job and start a record label, and making a spectacular mess of any potential relationship. With hindsight, and a year to look back at it, of course it wasn\u2019t a crisis. I was still trying to adjust to the fact that I wasn\u2019t a student anymore, as much as I might act like one.\nTokyo Police Club\u2019s brand new record \u2013 Forcefield \u2013 got fired over to me in the early, bleak days of a British January, and it has brought all those memories flooding back. I guess it helps that the vocalist was also born in 1987 (and has the same name as me), so is also going through the whole \u2018I\u2019m not twenty anymore but definitely not thirty either\u2019 feeling.\nLyrically it\u2019s a record full of anxieties, ideological escapism, and dealing with life\u2019s little adventures. Of course, being Tokyo Police Club, it\u2019s all wrapped up in perfect indie pop-rock noise. So often, on a first or second listen to a record, you\u2019ll think it\u2019s either a \u2018lyrics-first\u2019 album [Los Campesinos!, I\u2019m looking at you], or a \u2018music first\u2019 album. Forcefield somehow manages to be both of those things at once, which is a rare quality.\nLooking at the band\u2019s back catalogue, they\u2019ve never strayed over 4 minutes for a single track. This feels like a reflection of"

"times this year.\nAndrew Kim General manager Pan Pacific Hanoi\nBusiness and leisure travel will return at different paces, as will domestic and international travel. The first quarter of 2021 was no different than 2020. However, if there is no more local transit, we assume there will be growth in domestic travel. We assume the international border will remain closed until the end of the third quarter.\nIf we are looking at the near future, selling one\u2019s business property might not be a bad idea. But I strongly believe that we will travel again and reconnect again. By that time, travel will increase dramatically compared to before the pandemic. Once international travel is recovered, the property value will also hit another high.\nOur company has already applied a cost-containment plan including no new hiring, extending unpaid leave, and other initiatives. With revenue-driven sectors, we are more focused on the domestic market with events and restaurants.\nGarth Simmons CEO Southeast Asia Accor Hotels\nThanks to the Vietnamese government\u2019s public health measures, most of our hotels are still operating as usual. This is also a great opportunity for us to shift our focus to domestic travel, and the demand from this market has proven to be a driving force for the economy as well as the hospitality industry.\nWith a strong development pipeline for the next five years, we are confident in the long-term future of tourism and will go from 40 hotels to at least 50 in the country. Vietnam remains a country with huge potential in the coming years and we are introducing some exciting new brands, especially in the luxury and lifestyle sector.\nIn times of crises, we understand the best way to overcome the restrictions of international travel is by understanding the local culture and serving the domestic market. Accor\u2019s strategy moving forward is to bring our management teams closer to hotels and country leaders so we can gain insights on travel and hospitality trends in each market.\nThis will help us to deliver campaigns that allow our hotels to serve domestic guests with more tailored initiatives. We are also working closely with business partners in Vietnam to discover new destinations across the country, bringing exciting brands and providing professional hospitality training and job opportunities for a large number of new colleagues in remote destinations"
"week with Bill McKeon, president and CEO of the Texas Medical Center.\nCould we start with an overview of what is going on now with COVID-19? What are you seeing at the Texas Medical Center?\nWhat we\u2019re seeing, sadly, is more of the same, only with more intense numbers. The number of people who are testing positive in our community continues to escalate month over month. The test positivity rate is now at 15.1 percent.\nBut probably the most accurate reflection is our hospitalizations. We just reached an all-time high: 421 people were admitted to our hospitals for COVID yesterday.\nStep back for a second and look at that relative to the entire pandemic. Back in June and July, we had two weeks where the average number of hospital admissions was over 300. That was in the second wave.\nFast forward to wave three: We had four weeks that averaged over 300.\nNow we are into our second week with no slowing the pace. At 421 today, we are seeing the highest peak of all of the pandemic going back 18 months now.\nIt\u2019s largely a pandemic of the unwilling \u2014 people unwilling to be vaccinated. Now 44% of Houstonians are unvaccinated. Those are the vast majority of the people that are showing up in our emergency rooms and and in our ICUs. They\u2019re very sick.\nMany people thought that they were young, and therefore their immune system would be strong enough to protect them. That is not the case with this deadly delta variant, which is three times more transmissible than the earlier alpha variant.\nOur hospitals\u2019 staffs are 18 months into this. They\u2019re exhausted.\nAnd we have far fewer nurses than we used to have. They\u2019re being recruited to other states, like Florida, that are even worse off than Texas.\nThe saddest fact is, 18 percent of all the new cases so far in August are children.\nWith the alpha variant, everyone thought, \u201cOK, it\u2019s 65 and older.\u201d So we went after the nursing homes, and we did a brilliant job at protecting the elderly population and those who are immunocompromised.\n"
"the hedgerows, hazel catkins flung showers of pollen to the winds, and in the coppice that bordered the road pale-mauve March violets and white anemone stars showed through last year\u2019s carpet of dead leaves. There was that joyful thrill of spring in the air, that resurrection of Nature when the thraldom of winter is over, and beauty comes back to the gray dim world. The old Greeks felt it, thousands of years ago, and fabled it in their myth of Persephone and her return from Hades. The Druids knew it in Ancient Britain, and fixed their religious ceremonies for May Day. The birds were caroling it still in the hedgerows, and the girls caught the joyous infection and danced along in defiance of Miss Strong\u2019s jog-trot guide walk. Even the mistress herself, so wise at the outset, finally flung prudence to the winds, and skirmished through the coppices with enthusiasm equal to that of her pupils, lured from the pathway by the glimpses of kingcups, or the pursuit of a peacock butterfly.\n\u201cAll the same, if we tear round like small dogs, we shall never reach Dropwick tonight, and I\u2019ve booked our rooms there,\u201d she assured them. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to sleep on the heather, I suppose!\u201d\n\u201cBow-wow! Shouldn\u2019t mind!\u201d laughed Kitty. \u201cWe could cling together and keep each other warm.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t cling to me, thanks!

She photographed the company eating their lunch on a bank by the roadside, with Miss Strong in the very act of biting a piece of bread and butter, and Ingred with her face buried in a mug. She even went further. She had been reading a book on faked photography, and she yearned to try experiments.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to give those stay-at-homes a few thrills,\u201d she declared. \u201cI told them we\u2019d have adventures.\u201d\nNora exp"

"thought leaders within the Society for the Advancement of Consulting\u00ae (SAC). Companies realize they can no longer ignore this crucial business function, which belongs firmly in the C-Suite. This includes the thinking, actions, and initiatives that put the supply chain in a strategic context.\nInventory Accommodation or Optimization?\n\u201cAs a manufacturer, do you have an inventory accommodation strategy or an inventory optimization strategy?\u201d asks Patrick Daly, Managing Director of Alba Consulting, based in Dublin, Ireland. \u201cIn my work with manufacturing clients, I often find that they do not have any explicitly articulated strategy at all.\u201d\n\u201cFrequently, there is no feedback loop between infrastructure provision to accommodate inventory, and setting the policies that determine how much inventory the company holds to support manufacturing operations,\u201d explains Daly. \u201cConsequently, companies end up engaging in contradictory and counterproductive initiatives in different silos within the business.\n\u201cUnder pressure from excess inventories, operational managers will lobby for increased capital expenditure approvals or the expansion of spending on warehousing with third party logistics service providers,\u201d he says. \u201cMeanwhile, policies related to materials on hand, dual supply, supplier location and lead time, and minimum order quantities, are set or agreed upon without reference to the inventory accommodation consequences. The best results are achieved by explicitly tying these two strands together systemically with a coherent strategy.\u201d\nBoardroom Involvement Gaining Ground\n\u201cExecutives are quickly realizing that the end-to-end supply chain must be elevated to a strategic topic in the boardroom,\u201d points out Lisa Anderson, president of Claremont, CA-based LMA Consulting Group, Inc and a manufacturing expert known for creating supply chain resiliency. \u201cMany companies were caught off guard during the pandemic with limited resiliency, highlighting this issue.\u201d\n\u201cReshoring is on the rise.

"protocol. Unfortunately, the changes are not backward-compatible. For that reason, OSPF version 1 will not interoperate with OSPF version 2. However, the changes are small in scope and should not greatly affect any existing implementations. In addition, some of the proposed changes should enable future protocol additions to be made in a backward- compatible manner (see Section F.4).\nF.1 Protocol Enhancements\nThe following enhancements were made to the OSPF protocol.\nF.1.1 Stub area support\nIn many Autonomous Systems, the majority of the OSPF link state database consists of AS external advertisements. In these Autonomous Systems, some OSPF areas may be organized in such a way that external advertisements can be safely ignored, enabling a reduction of the area's database size. This applies to OSPF areas where there is only a single exit/entry that is used by all externally addressed packets, or to cases where some sub-optimality of external routing is acceptable.\nTherefore, an OSPF area configuration option has been added (see Sections 3.6 and C.2) allowing the import of external advertisements to be disabled for an area. When this option is enabled, no AS external advertisements will be flooded into the area (Sections 13, 13.3 and 10.3). Instead, within the area all data traffic to external destinations will follow a (per-area) default route. These areas are called \"stub\" areas.\nTo implement this, all area border routers attached to stub areas will originate a default summary link advertisement for the area (Section 12.4.3). This will direct all internal routers to an area border router when forwarding externally addressed packets. In addition, to ensure that stub areas are configured consistently, an Options field has been added to OSPF Hello packets (Sections A.2 and A.3.2). A bit is reset in the Options field indicating that the attached area is a stub area (Section 9.5). A router will not accept a neighbor's hellos unless they both agree on the area's ability to process AS external advertisements (Section 10.5). In this way, a system administrator will be able to discover incorrectly configured routers,"

"raptured by the two dolls. Years later when I visited Harriet in Seattle, she regretted having given the Lenci pair to her grandchildren instead of to me, since they had destroyed them.\nThe two photos above are part of Anne\u2019s Lenci collection)\nAlthough I still loved Sasha dolls and often dropped by my favourite down town doll shop to see the latest Trendons, as well as saved all the Sasha catalogues from the mid 1970s on, I didn\u2019t buy the dolls for a variety of reasons, but mainly because my husband didn\u2019t like them, much preferring Lencis. He\u2019s changed his mind by now, I think, or, if not, at least he respects the Sasha doll\u2019s concept and history. Then, too, since I believed the English Sashas would always be around, there seemed no rush to delve into my pocketbook. My friend Molly had all of the limited editions, plus a few others, which I enjoyed, but neither of us knew much of their history or even that Studio Sashas existed, to say nothing about the early G\u00f6tz production. Then, one afternoon in February 1986, I was early to meet mother\u2019s bus, so to pass an hour, I stopped by Arnold\u2019s Fairyland. The proprietor knew me well and my attraction to Sasha. She told me the factory had stopped making them, and all but one of the Sasha dolls on her shelves had sold immediately. A lone Cora, wearing a floral print dress, stood on the shelf looking at me\u2026 I put her on layaway and immediately left to go down the street to the only other doll shop, which carried Sasha, the one where I?d found Alma six years before. The shop had Marina, Gingham, and White Dress, plus a few packaged outfits, so I put everything on layaway. When paid off, I brought my new Sasha dolls home, and told my husband they were a financial investment. Secretly taking them out of their boxes to study them, I realized these Sasha dolls didn\u2019t match my memory of Ellen\u2019s Sasha from 1966, and upon comparison, my interest was whetted by the differences I observed.

"15\u201317] with the concomitant release of DNA that will become available for transformation. The existence of two predominant Selumetinib price pherotypes in S. pneumoniae and the documented occurrence\nof co-colonization [18, 19], led to the proposal of two contrasting models of the pherotype impact on genetic exchange [15]. In the first model, the lack of inter-pherotype communication prevents genetic exchange between phenotypes favoring genetic differentiation [20, 21]. The second model is based on the proposal that the absence of inter-pherotype cross-activation would result in a race for competence activation with the winning phenotype inducing the lysis of cells belonging to the other pherotype [22]. The latter would result in a more frequent exchange of genetic information between different pherotype lineages that is assumed to result in enhanced genetic diversity of pneumococci. The human\nhost is the only natural ecological niche of all pneumococcal strains where they are exposed to the same environmental insults and share very similar lifestyles. We propose that limitations to lateral gene transfer, through a kind of \u201c\u201dassortative mating\u201d\" promoted by Amisulpride the existence of two pherotypes, is creating genetically differentiated subpopulations within S. pneumoniae.

Although it has been shown that the serotype defines important epidemiological and virulence properties of pneumococcal isolates [24], it is also recognized that each serotype comprises different clones that may present different properties [25].

"functional anatomy of the iliotibial band during flexion and extension of the knee: implications for understanding iliotibial band syndrome. J Anat. 2006 Mar;208(3):309\u2013316. PubMed #16533314 \u2750 PainSci #56738 \u2750\nIliotibial band (ITB) syndrome is a common overuse injury in runners and cyclists. It is regarded as a friction syndrome where the ITB rubs against (and 'rolls over') the lateral femoral epicondyle. Here, we re-evaluate the clinical anatomy of the region to challenge the view that the ITB moves antero-posteriorly over the epicondyle. Gross anatomical and microscopical studies were conducted on the distal portion of the ITB in 15 cadavers. This was complemented by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of six asymptomatic volunteers and studies of two athletes with acute ITB syndrome. In all cadavers, the ITB was anchored to the distal femur by fibrous strands, associated with a layer of richly innervated and vascularized fat. In no cadaver, volunteer or patient was a bursa seen. The MR scans showed that the ITB was compressed against the epicondyle at 30 degrees of knee flexion as a consequence of tibial internal rotation, but moved laterally in extension. MR signal changes in the patients with ITB syndrome were present in the region occupied by fat, deep to the ITB. The ITB is prevented from rolling over the epicondyle by its femoral anchorage and because it is a part of the fascia lata. We suggest that it creates the illusion of movement, because of changing tension in its anterior and posterior fibres during knee flexion. Thus, on anatomical grounds, ITB overuse injuries may be more likely to be associated with fat compression beneath the tract, rather than with repetitive friction as the knee flexes and extends.\nFairclough J, Hayashi K, Toumi H, et al.

". PFL implies that the person is the same with or without their diagnosis, and the majority of the autistic community agrees that their autism is a fundamental part of who they are.\nNeurodivergent conditions, including autism, are brain differences, meaning that they impact who the person is.\nSome autistic individuals prefer PFL or state that they have no preference, so when addressing them, use what they prefer. But when referring to the autistic community at large, the best practice is to determine what the majority of community members prefer because true allies value community voices.\nMultiple surveys conducted over the past decade have shown that, while context plays a role in what language is most appropriate to use, IFL is generally preferred by the autistic community.\n'Autistic Not Weird' Survey Results\nOne survey conducted in March 2022 by Autistic Not Weird (an advocacy organization run by and for autistic people) received more than 11,000 responses.\nJust over 76% of autistic respondents indicated a preference for IFL, or that they always wanted to be referred to as an \u201cautistic person\u201d rather than a \u201cperson with autism.\u201d\nJust under 4% indicated a strong preference for \u201cperson with autism.\u201d\n15% indicated that either term felt appropriate, and about 5% declined to answer the question.\nOverall, this data points to a community preference for IFL in relation to autism.\nAutistic Voices\nIn researching for this article, several autistic people provided their insight into their own preferences around PFL and IFL.\nSimilar to the Autistic Not Weird survey, most indicated a strong preference for IFL. A few people indicated no preference or noted that PFL used to be the standard.\nThoughts on PFL and IFL From Autistic People\nCris, an autistic artist, writer, and research biologist, shared: \u201cMost autistics consider it to be who they are. Identity versus person shouldn\u2019t be a thing because they are one and the same. I am autistic.

"With evidence accumulating that excess sugar is at least partly responsibility for suppressing the immune system, making Americans obese and depressed, and causing disease, is it OK to let your children binge for a few days?\nTo make that decision, it's helpful to know what happens inside us when we swallow something that's mostly made of sugar, like the 91 pieces of candy that the average child collects while trick-or-treating.\nYour bloodstream on sugar\nIn the first 10 minutes, the body breaks down the sugar \u2014 6 teaspoons of sugar in a Twix, 7 teaspoons in Butterfinger and 10 in a 3 Musketeers, according to Medical News Today \u2014 and makes it available for energy.\nRefined sugar \u2014 the kind we spoon into coffee or find in candy and baked goods \u2014 is made from sugar cane or sugar beets, and the body converts it into glucose and fructose.\nGlucose goes straight to the bloodstream; fructose is processed by the liver, which either releases it later into the bloodstream or turns it into fat through a process called lipogenesis, according to the Harvard Heart Newsletter. These fat globules can stick around and eventually turn into nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\nIf that's not bad enough, a constant assault of fructose on the liver can also increase blood pressure and bad cholesterol, fatten our organs and increase the production of free radicals, the compounds that accelerate aging.\nMeanwhile, a half-hour into a sugar binge, the body secretes dopamine, the feel-good hormone that makes us want more. While sugar's effect is not as strong as a heroin addiction, it's enough to nudge us into a pattern of craving, which is why Eliza Barclay wrote for NPR that people should indulge in sweets \"rarely and cautiously.\"\n\"Otherwise, there's a pretty good chance that your brain is going to start demanding sugar loudly and often,\" she said.\nFinally, after an hour or so, comes the crash: the low-energy, irritability and headache that can accompany fluctuations in blood sugar.\nIt'"
"& Fairy Tales\nPublished on December 7, 2014 December 7, 2014 by valerieholmesauthor1 Comment\nChristmas would not be Christmas in the UK without the onset of the pantomime season. Theaters up and down the land give way to the colourful, family, slap-stick humour of the pantomime. Celebrities appear in the most surprising roles to join in the seasonal fun.

"system. It's not a new concept in bullpup designs, as others \u2212 like the FN F2000 or the Kel-Tec RFB \u2212 already rely on a forward-ejecting mechanism, which in most times however means that spent cases are not ejected outright from the gun but moved to an \"ejection tunnel\", running besides or over the barrel, and pushed outside by other ejected cases that come right behind, or falling down if the user lowers the gun towards the ground.\nThis means that in urban operations \u2212 when the muzzle is almost kept upright, as operators have to be on constant watch for hostile fire coming from windows \u2212 these designs may have not enough force to eject the spent cases, and jams may occur. Another forward ejection system, which relies on the movement of a reciprocating cocking handle to forcefully eject the cases from the rifle, is found on the Russian-made KBP A-91M rifle, but said platform is rarely seen outside Russia and there has been no civilian-grade sporting version so far.\nSporting a 10.5 inches barrel, the MDR-C version is barely 20-inches long overall\nThe \"Micro-Dynamic Rifle - Compact\" from Desert-Tech will be available -- and convertible -- in three different calibers\nMuch like the full-size MDR, the MDR-C is due to be commercially available in early 2015\nFeaturing the same forward ejection system as the full-size MDR, the MDR-C has been conceived for covert carry, close protection, personal defense and other special applications\nThe \"Micro-Dynamic Rifle\" features an ejection window on the right side only, and a slightly hook-shaped, spring-loaded ejector that normally lays against the left wall of the receiver; the window is covered by a metal sheet dust cover featuring itself a short ejection tube.

"audit found that there was not a substantial difference in the number of process changes reported by batch and continuous applicants. However, continuous applicants reported no changes related to equipment, processing conditions, or batch-size range. Tsinontides says, \u201cThis observation aligns with the fact that continuous processes are often designed to have inherent flexibility to tailor production to demand.\u201d\nAn FDA pre-approval inspection was conducted for the majority of batch products and all of the continuous products. \u201cWhile continuous applications had more process-related issues observed during inspections than batch applications, it stands to reason that as FDA\u2019s confidence in continuous manufacturing increases, the need for pre-approval inspections and the number of process-related issues should lessen,\u201d contends Lee. The most important finding for continuous manufacturers was that pre-approval inspections did not adversely impact application approval timelines, as all were approved in the first FDA review cycle ahead of the goal date.\nOwing to his engagements with technology developers in the Emerging Technology Program, Lee found another issue faced by manufacturers wanting to adopt continuous strategies. Many had faith in FDA\u2019s willingness and ability to approve continuous manufacturing applications but had doubts about that of other global regulators. Often manufacturers deal with dozens of global regulators for a single international product launch.\nTo address this problem, Lee initiated an international effort to describe harmonized scientific and regulatory considerations for continuous manufacturing. The result was an international guideline on continuous manufacturing dubbed ICH Q13. \u201cThe goal of ICH Q13 is to commit regulators to consistent adoption of consensus-based guidelines to realize the benefits of continuous manufacturing for patients as well as industry,\u201d says Lee. The ICH Q13 guideline has undergone global public consultation and is expected to be finalized before the end of the year. FDA\u2019s hope is that manufacturers will have more confidence in the global regulatory support for continuous manufacturing adoption.\nAs continuous manufacturing transitions from the innovators to the early adopters in pharma, it seems the question is when, not if, pharma will broadly embrace continuous manufacturing. The rapidly changing demand caused by COVID-19 displayed the value of manufacturing agility and the problems caused by long,"

Throughout the year, they offer $5,000 awards to 1,000 female entrepreneurs globally.\n- Alisha Taylor, Alisha Taylor Interiors\nFemale entrepreneurs can find great success in raising money through crowdfunding. Crowdfunding is a finance strategy that involves drawing funds through multiple sources instead of relying on one lender. You can raise any amount of money and there is no limit to the number of people who can contribute to your fund. There are no restrictions to who the source is, meaning that friends, family, or even strangers are just as qualified to participate in a crowdfunding campaign as an experienced investor or established professional. This technique can be helpful in raising the total amount of funding needed for an investment or supplementing the remainder of the total money needed that a traditional lender may not fully cover.\n- Than Merrill, FortuneBuilders\nFor women-funded brands, there are exponentially growing numbers of venture-funded options dedicated to empowering diverse teams. One such option is SoGal Ventures.

"CP, rodents only have limited expression of CR1 that is generated by alternative splicing from the Cr1/2 gene.21 In place of MCP, the rodent-specific complement regulator Crry is expressed ubiquitously in mice (e.g. endothelium, mesangium, tubules)18,19 and is considered a functional homolog of human MCP.13,22 Clinically, strong connections between complement and kidney diseases have been provided by cases of deficiency or dysfunction of the fluid-phase complement regulators fH\nand fI.23\u201327 Unlike the membrane-bound inhibitors, the fluid-phase inhibitors circulate in the plasma and are largely produced outside the kidney in the liver.15,16,28 However, there is evidence that fH can be synthesized by some phagocytic cells and by murine platelets GSK458 nmr and podocytes.16,18,29,30 These observations notwithstanding, the current view of fH function, supported by both clinical MLN0128 and animal modelling studies, is that it works principally as a fluid-phase protein to prevent AP complement activation in the plasma as well as on the cell\nsurface (Fig. 3). The latter activity of fH is dependent on its C-terminal domains that bind to surface deposited C3b in the context of host cell-specific polyanionic constituents (Fig. 3).31,32 The identity of the host cell components with which fH interacts has not been positively identified, although heparin has been used frequently as a model ligand in in vitro experiments and several studies have shown that fH can bind to glycosaminoglycans expressed on the cell surface.33,34 Whatever the binding partner(s) may be, it is clear that fH attachment to renal endothelial cells is essential to kidney health, particularly under pathological conditions.32,35 Many of the kidney disorders that have been linked to complement can be attributed to insufficient complement regulation, either as a result of regulator deficiency or dysfunction, or due to exuberant AP complement amplification that"

My bottom front teeth were smashing the backs of my upper teeth and utterly destroying them! I went in search of a prosthodontist, which is a dentist with about three years more training than a normal dentist. I needed an expert who could build my teeth back up so that my front teeth would be saved. I could not find anyone in Canada or the US who could do the work in a reasonable time frame; and, their prices were far too high! On the internet I checked in Mexico and Costa Rica. I was leaning towards Costa Rica because I had previously lived there.\nI did contact three prosthodontists in Mexico but I found them to be rude and I did not trust them regarding materials. I corresponded with three prosthodontists in Costa Rica and decided to fly down to see one of them. It turned out that he had lied about something he had said in an email, so, I tried one of the other dentists instead. That did not work out either and the third guy was newly trained and he told me that he was not confident that he could restore my bite. I obtained a list of prosthodontists in Costa Rica and began to contact all of them by phone or email. Some"

With the advancement of the internet and technologies, there\u2019s no need to spend extra time on those tasks anymore. According to Allied Market Research, the global mobile banking market was valued at $715 million in 2018 and is expected to exceed $1,824 million by 2026. It clearly shows that the banking industry is among those areas that benefit the most from digitalization.\nReading these lines, you\u2019re probably thinking about building a mobile banking experience for users. However, you must be armed with the knowledge to make this work. So we've prepared a guide to help you create a banking app that\u2019ll meet your business goals and customers\u2019 needs.\nBanks that go mobile gain a competitive edge. They build banking apps to:\nLevel up service quality\nIncrease client base\nWe\u2019ll consider the most significant benefits that banks will get by becoming mobile-friendly.\nWider Client Base\nBy providing users with an additional way to interact with the bank, you expand your customer base and offer new services. In fact, users appreciate the ability to use banking services online. There are over 57 million mobile banking users in the US and more than 130 million in Europe.\nNew Marketing Channel\nAdvertising is important for any business. The more distribution channels you have, the better. By developing a mobile banking application, you gain an additional way to advertise your services.\nYou can notify users about new app features, credit services, rates, and their changes using push notifications. This way, you\u2019ll always be in touch with customers and your advertising will be less intrusive than direct sales in a bank branch.\nGood Return on Investment Ratio\nIt takes considerable investments to develop a mobile banking app. The return on investment is quite high though.

In contrast, FEV1/FVC did not associate significantly with any of the SNPs in the Ansan, Ansung, or total populations. Table 2 indicates the associations between the SNPs in the ALOX5AP and FEV1 or FEV1/FVC. Two LD blocks were identified among the 13 intronic SNPs in the ALOX5AP gene (Fig. 1). The haplotypes with frequencies below 5% were filtered out. Ten SNPs were included in the second LD block, which had a relatively high D\u2019 (>0.9) and R2 value as well as containing two exons. Therefore, diplotypes with tagging Z-VAD-FMK molecular weight SNPs were used for analysis. Each LD block had three and four haplotypes, respectively. Of these, the diplotype of haplotype AA in block 1 associated significantly with FEV1 (P = 0.023); FEV1 increased 0.997 per haplotype AA was existed.

"he wails. The moment is an effective microcosm of the entire album, in which fleeting sparks of genuine love are inevitably dampened by harsh realities, worst of all time.\nAt first, \u201cGod Forbid\u201d is a bit of an anomaly. Stuck at the very end, it\u2019s by far the rawest track to be found on Anthems, with almost no production to speak of whatsoever. (Then again, there\u2019s nothing much to produce: this is just Cogman alone in his room with his guitar.) Far from providing anything resembling hope, the melodies are dark, hopeless, and unresolved, and the lyrics are just confusing. Strange as it may be to end on the most downbeat track, however, it ends on a brief note of closure as Cogman puts down the guitar, gets up, and leaves the room. Ultimately, the last thing we hear on Anthems is the closing of a door\u2014and presumably the opening of new ones.\nIf at times my writing makes Cogman's work sound like some ancient old tome, that\u2019s because it was, in fact, intended for a different time. The liner notes testify that some songs had been written as early as 2003, and most of them had been ready to go by 2008. From there, it was an uphill battle with personal struggles, funding, and touring before a release date was finally stated: March 2012, three years after Cogman had initially planned for it to be released.\nBut the truths contained within this work are truths that are just as true now as they must have been then. Its insights are small but universal, its melodies lightweight but durable, its cover scratched but built to last. There\u2019s always room for love songs in our lives, and the ten on Anthems will stand the test of time yet. And for what it\u2019s worth, Cogman seems to agree:\n\u201cAnd I have learned there is beauty in this sorrow\n\u2018Cause the girl that doesn\u2019t love me\nIs the song I\u2019ll write tomorrow.\u201d\nYou can download all of Marc M.

"exactly quick by today's standards, that's still respectable and more than enough to have a good time every day. The BRZ's scant weight also gives the sports car excellent handling characteristics that few can match.\nThe other great thing about the lightweight design and small engine is fuel efficiency. Fuel economy for the BRZ is rated at an EPA-estimated 24 miles per gallon city, 33 mpg highway, and 27 combined with the automatic transmission.\nThere are two available trims:\nPricing for the Premium trim starts at $26,860 (all prices include the $885 destination charge). Standard exterior features include 17-inch wheels, LED headlights, a rear spoiler, and body-color and heated side mirrors. On the inside, the trim comes with a six-way manually adjustable driver's seat, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, cloth upholstery, power windows, a manually adjustable tilt-and-telescopic column, manual air conditioning, a 6.2-inch touchscreen, an eight-speaker audio system, Bluetooth, and an auxiliary jack. Subaru doesn't offer any optional packages on the Premium, but it does allow drivers to choose from various dealer-installed features.\nThe Limited trim costs $29,530. It adds LED fog lights, heated front seats, leather-trimmed upholstery, a 4.2-inch multi-function display, dual-zone automatic climate control, a seven-inch touchscreen, and two USB ports. Adding the automatic transmission costs $1,100, while the Performance Package ($1,195) brings upgraded Brembo brakes, 17-inch wheels, and high performance dampers.\nIf the Subaru badge bothers you, or you manage to find a better deal at a Toyota dealership, the latter sells an identical model to the BRZ, which is called the 86. While we usually tend to lean toward the cheapest trim available when it comes to sports cars, the ability to get some creature comforts and even more performance draws us to the 2019 Subaru BRZ Limited. We'd tick the box for the available Performance"

", despite a lot of flaws and the signs of a tumultuous production, the movie still has a lot to entertain and certainly has its charm, especially now that it\u2019s aged somewhat\u2026though not as gracefully as we\u2019d like. And as my idea of Batman and his Joker were better portrayed by Nolan\u2019s The Dark Knight, I can now let this movie slide on a few of its issues as it is no longer the only film on the subject. Also stars Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon, Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent and Tracey Walter as Joker\u2019s top henchman Bob.\n\u2026 as a final note, it\u2019s kind of interesting that I\u2019ve read where Tim Burton has been said to say he finds the movie boring and proclaim that it\u2019s not a great movie. I agree it\u2019s not a great movie, but it isn\u2019t boring and will always be regarded, even by me, as a classic despite its flaws. These statements only give more substance to me of the notion that this film was not totally his and there were a lot of cooks involved in the bat soup which may explain why many aspects of the production are so uneven.\nRated 3 (out of 4) bat signals!\nNow this was more like it! As for what I wanted from Burton\u2019s first Batman, this sequel is a lot closer to it. The film feels a lot more like a \u2018Tim Burton\u2019 film and a lot of the problems from Batman, have been eliminated or fixed such as booting the Vale and Knox characters and having a more consistently sinister villain and a far livelier and sexier leading lady\u2026 and no Prince music to date the film like last time\u2026And for the record, I think Prince is a musical genius and has some great tunes, but they don\u2019t belong in a Batman movie. The story is still not the strongest\u2026none of this era\u2019s Batman movies had strong plots\u2026but it makes up for it by strengthening a lot of other weaknesses including a more gothic look and a snowy Christmas setting with a bit more of a devious sense of humor.\nWe start out with the wealthy Cobblepot family (Pee Wee\u2019s Big Adventure vets Paul Reubens and Diane Salinger) wel"

Recife is also one of the first Brazilian cities to release data generated by public sector organizations for public use as open data. Then Open Data Portal Recife was created to offer access to a repository of governmental machine-readable data about several domains, including: finances, health, education and tourism. Data is available in CSV and GeoJSON formats and every dataset has metadata that helps in the understanding and usage of the data. However, the metadata is not provided using standard vocabularies or taxonomies. In general, data is created in a static way, where data from relational databases are exported in a CSV format and then published in the data catalog. Currently, work is under way to dynamically generate data from relational databases so that data will be available as soon as it is created. The main phases of the development of this initiative were: to educate people with appropriate knowledge concerning open data, relevant data identification in order to identify the sources of data that their potential consumers could find useful, data extraction and transformation from the original data sources to open formats, configuration and installation of the open data catalog tool, data publication and portal release.\nDomains: Base registers, cultural heritage information, geographic information, infrastructure information, social data and tourism information\nObligation/motivation: Data that must be provided to the public under a legal obligation (Brazilian Information Access Act, edited in 2012); Provide public data to citizens.\nUsage: Data that supports democracy and transparency; data used by application developers.\nQuality: Verified and clean data.\nSize: in general small to medium CSV files.\nType/format: CSV, GeoJson\nRate of change: different rates of change depending on the data source.\nPotential audience: application developers, startups, government organizations.\nUse of common vocabularies to facilitate data integration.\nProvide structural metadata to help understanding and usage"

Funnily enough, Getafe is the team that Blanco made his La Liga debut against and Cadiz is the team and the city where Blanco made his first La Liga start. Under Zidane, Blanco played 4 matches in La Liga in the 2020-2021 season, but his first team progress stunted last year under Ancelotti, only making 1 La Liga appearance. The player has been in a strange limbo between Castilla and the first team for a couple of seasons now, but now looks set to depart the club in search of more top flight minutes.\nReal Madrid are expected to extend Anotnio Blanco\u2019s current contract by another two years, moving from 2023 to 2025, and then loan him out to Cadiz for the season. Blanco will join former Real Madrid Castilla teammate, Victor Chust. If all goes to plan, the deal will be wrapped up this week and Blanco could debut against Osasuna this weekend. There will be no option to buy for Cadiz - it will be a strict loan deal.

"think (note that I wasn't one of the key people so this is more speculative). There was some tech support available from volunteers but then it stopped and it was hard to determine what was needed to solve the various issues that existed and how to hire for/fund that role. (Reminds me that another issue with decentralised/volunteer tech development is that there are many different codebases/stacks used and inefficiencies in handovers, or lack of).\nWith the other charities, I don't know why they didn't hire tech support. I think that one issue is that they want to keep overheads down for marketing reasons. Another is the risk of such work. It could go bad or break something. They possible also didn't have much headspace for innovation. I think that most of these orgs had just enough capacity to keep the charity going but not much more than that.\nThanks, those are great case studies! Given that it wasn't worth your time to seek funding for and plan a website, would you say that that a 50-66% discount would have made the difference? (ie the total discount you would get directly from a low-bono charity, or that the movement as a whole would get from a donor-funded one)\nTo play Devil's advocate, that seems like a relatively fine-grained cost-benefit analysis in a movement where a) there's now a lot of money floating around and b) we think the best projects are multiple orders of magnitude more valuable than a typical non-EA charitable project. If there are other considerations that would make you think an EA tech agency would have made a bigger difference in practice, can you describe in your own words what they were?\nwould you say that that a 50-66% discount would have made the difference?\nProbably not as we were unfunded and unwilling to self fund to any great extent. What would have helped would be a source of work we could reliably outsource to for free or for a 90% subsidy. I could imagine that we might self-fund up to 1000aud say, for a website/work valued at 10,000 Aud. But that's just speculation"

Kristy Pagan, D-Canton.\nTwo of the bills would protect survivors against housing discrimination and against evictions arising from domestic violence-related disturbances.\nAnother would allow survivors to get unemployment compensation if they have to leave their job because of violence or stalking.\nAnother would give survivors sick leave to take care of medical and legal issues related to their domestic violence situations.\nFinally, one bill would require someone who has been served a personal protection order for domestic violence to turn in or sell their firearms.\n\"The more survivors have support and resources, the more likely they are to use those resources, which ideally will end the cycle of violence,\" said Pagan.\n\"A lot of survivors unfortunately do not report,\" Pagan said. \"But the statistics that we have state that nearly three in ten women will experience some sort of physical violence from an intimate partner in their lifetime - well as one in ten men.

However, he\u2019s yet to prove his worth at the major-league level, as evidenced by his .150/.216/.187 batting line across 118 MLB plate appearances. The Redbirds have also called up lefty Tyler Webb and righty Daniel Poncedeleon.\nThe Phillies have opted to recall outfielder Aaron Altherr, who\u2019d largely been a fixture in the club\u2019s major-league outfield for the past two seasons prior to a late-July demotion. While his 13.3% walk rate so far this season was downright fantastic, that was about the only aspect of Altherr\u2019s performance to be happy about; he was striking out at a 32.7% clip while hitting just .171 and slugging just .305.

"father's ashes mingle with the bronze, tannin-rich waters, like grey flakes of sand catching flashes of sunlight as the current carried them away. That's how much love we had wrapped up in those rivers.\nRapids or not, current or not much, we were now headed on an overnight canoe trip down a river I chose to call the \"mighty Mullica\", no matter how mighty it might turn out to be. Their generous offer had turned the tide enough to lure my urbaphilic family out of its routines, to venture beyond the limits of creature comforts and into the New Jersey hinterlands.\nThe Mullica, draining the largest watershed in the pine barrens, was as advertised--narrow, slow-flowing--and yet its tight-cornered meanderings presented a surprising challenge even for a seasoned canoeist. Put your paddle down long enough to take a photo and the current might carry you gently but surely into a tangle of shrubbery.\nI had to draw on muscle memory to bring back the variety of paddle strokes needed to maneuver past lovely obstructions like this pine tree fallen across the water. There always seemed to be just enough room to slip by.\nThe narrow channel offered a more intimate encounter with the surroundings than a big river, akin to a magical boardwalk that carried us along through an unspoiled landscape.\nBeing the designated botanist for the journey, in the great tradition of early European explorations of America, albeit on a somewhat tamer scale, I immediately started grooving on the foliage. Hey. Sweet pepperbush, everybody! Also called summersweet because of its fragrance, which must really be sweet when canoeing this river earlier in the season, because it lines the banks for miles. Alas, no one was listening. The kids on the trip--enough to make a ten kid pyramid later in the trip--had all raced ahead in their sporty kayaks.\nWe canoeists, laden with camping gear, held down the rear, allowing time to admire the beauty of the current's play on some sort of underwater grass. The grasslike clumps on the banks are actually tus"

At 200lbs/pc 1 Million Powerwalls would need 200 MILLION pounds of lithium or 100,000 tons. (90,718 Metric Tonnes)\nOh wait: that\u2019s more Lithium than is mined in WHOLE CONTINENTS, like top producer Australia @ 42,000 tonnes. Next is Chile, 18,000 tonnes.\nI detect a problem.\nMore problems follow. Lithium is both unbelievably reactive and unbelievably toxic. It catches on fire in water \u2014 not like there\u2019s any \u201cwater\u201d where humans live, and as lithium is a major ingredient in psychology drugs, causing mood leveling or even erasing emotions altogether, and doesn\u2019t decay, even a small amount of escaped lithium is a big deal. That\u2019s both in the Pecos and Red River, AND at the mining site, where it consumes tens of thousands of gallons in the world\u2019s driest environments, like Bolivia.\nThe Environmental Impact of Lithium Batteries\n\u201cLithium extraction harms the soil and causes air contamination. In Argentina\u2019s Salar de Hombre Muerto, residents believe that lithium operations contaminated streams used by humans and livestock and for crop irrigation. In Chile, the landscape is marred by mountains of discarded salt and canals filled with contaminated water with an unnatural blue hue.\n\u2026 In Australia, only two percent of the country\u2019s 3,300 metric tons of lithium-ion waste is recycled.\n\u2026 recovered cells are usually shredded, creating a mixture of metal that can then be separated using pyrometallurgical techniques\u2014burning\u2014which wastes a lot of the lithium.\u201d\n\u201cTwo other key ingredients, cobalt and nickel, are more in danger of creating a bottleneck in the move towards electric vehicles, and at a potentially huge environmental cost.

"ed down operations and been the source of much frustration for franchisees. Long wait times have also sparked many customer complaints.\nThe TasteCrafted menu may exacerbate this problem. Not only does adding options slow down prep time and take up additional space in the kitchen, but it also makes the ordering process slower. Instead of simply ordering a #1 with Coke, for example, an uninitiated customer will now have to answer at least three questions regarding their choice of meat, bun, and topping. For a single or double-file drive thru, those extra options could result in long waits. As a result, the Create Your Taste Menu is only available from kiosks inside the restaurant to prevent expected delays in the drive-thru lane.\nMcDonald's is also well aware of its menu bloat as it recently axed 9 offerings, but adding new options may negate any improvements in service from the simplified menu.\nCustomization is not the keyWhile it is fair to point out that customization is central to the menu at Chipotle, that is not the case at many of the currently popular fast casual chains.Shake Shack, which has grown from a hot dog stand into a $2.5 billion publicly traded company in the past ten years, offers only five types of burgers on its menu with little customization. In-N-Out Burger, perhaps the original cult favorite of burger chains, has just three burger options on its official menu.\nThe difference, then, between the growing chains and McDonald's is not customization but quality. Shake Shack and In-N-Out simply offer a better product.\nFor Mickey D's, the remedy to that solution is not to compete in the $8 gourmet burger space which is already too crowded. The company serves a different clientele. Keep in mind that Burger King saw its same-store sales in North America jump nearly 7% in the first quarter, while McDonald's fell by almost 3%. McDonald's needs to recapture those customers first, before it worries about falling too far behind fast casual competition.\nOffering customers a choice is not a bad thing in and of itself, but it is a problem when it comes at the expense of speed of service and efficiency"
"ative course. However, they are highly valuable intra-operatively as well. Each of these modalities can be co-registered to a structural MRI scan and uploaded to a frameless stereotactical intra-operative neuronavigational system.\nWith the functional imaging data thus integrated into the intra-operative navigation, it becomes a powerful tool for identifying in real time those regions that have been pre-operatively identified with a given functional study. While these techniques lack the accuracy of direct electrocortical stimulation mapping (see Figure 9c\u2013d), they are increasingly useful adjuncts in the operative management of gliomas.\nIntra-operative imaging is playing an increasing role in the surgical management of gliomas. Current techniques allow the surgeon to define functional brain regions, navigate accurately during the surgical resection, identify critical structures and maximise the extent of resection while preserving function. As these modalities become increasingly refined and complex, a thorough understanding of their advantages and limitations will lead to better outcomes for patients.\nPhiroz E Tarapore, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, 505 Parnassus Avenue, Box 0112, San Francisco, CA 94143-0112, US.

"ican ideas in their classes, and if you read the KnoWhys published by Book of Mormon Central America and republished by Mesomania Magazine, you'll see how devoted these people are to the two-Cumorahs theory.\nIt's actually a nice persuasion tactic for these scholars to say we don't know where Cumorah is. It makes them sound open-minded, when they're anything but that.\nUpton Sinclair wrote, \"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!\" In this case, it may not be salary, but any of a number of other factors, that cause these scholars and educators to not understand.\nMaybe it's just Mesomania.\nI've previously analyzed the intellectual history of the problem, including the development of the so-called \"two-Cumorahs\" theory. Basically, here's the argument:\n1. First, some RLDS and LDS scholars concluded that the Book of Mormon took place in Central America (aka, Mesoamerica).\n2. They determined that this setting meant New York was too far away to be the location of Cumorah. 3. They concluded that Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery started, or perpetuated, a false tradition that their successors have continued to perpetuate.\n4. They rationalized that there are two Cumorahs; i.e., a fake Cumorah (Moroni's Cumorah) in New York which is merely the place where Moroni buried his plates, and the \"real\" Cumorah (Mormon's Cumorah) in Southern Mexico which is the scene of the final battles and the place where Mormon hid the repository of Nephite records (Mormon 6:6). There are actually LDS scholars in Mexico scouting around for the \"real Cumorah.\"\n5. Lately, these LDS scholars have said that whenever a prophet or apostle says something about Cumorah that contradicts what the scholars say, that prophet or aspostle was merely expressing his opinion and was wrong.\n6.

Today the winery has a functional winemaking area which houses the 100-150 hl stainless steel tanks and the original 80-200 hl concrete vats, which have been restored on the outside and lined with glass on the inside, but all preserved in the full awareness of regaining a value and a fundamental tradition.\nThe part dedicated to ageing in wood winds along a route made up of adjoining rooms, but is separated into sectors. Here, different wooden barrels have found accommodation and have been picked out to enhance the different features of the crus during ageing. The original circular 50-60 hl Slavonian oak barrels contain mainly the vintage Brunello. The 60-hl truncated-cone barrels are used to age the Poggio al Granchio, after a brief stay in barriques. The 52-hl oval barrels are used to age the Vigna del Lago, while the 300-litre French barriques are used for the ageing of Vigna Spuntali.\nHome > The Project<s> Why does TV video appear so different than that which is produced with normal video camcorder?\nJuly 27, 2008 10:14 PM Subscribe\nI am wondering why videos produced for TV appear not only smoother, but have a very \"distant\" or unreal sense to them, whereas videos recorded by camcorder appear very raw and real like the way they happen in reality. I am not referring to the jitter caused by holding a camera, of course, but the different \"quality\" and properties that tv produced videos have. This is especially visible when you see low-budget commercials for cars/furniture, then back to regular TV quality.

"ited. All inks used are vegetable based and all pulp is Elemental Chlorine free (ECF)\nAnnual Report Pioneering Better Science\nOver the last year, we have concentrated on our key strengths in bringing communities together, in fostering new science and innovative problem solving, and establishing new collaborations. This report summarises some of our highlights from 2013. We have demonstrated that first class science and the 3Rs can go hand-in-hand and as a result we have seen demand for our resources increase again in 2013. We have responded to this with new funding opportunities to support 3Rs infrastructure and networking, and new strategic partnerships, including an exciting collaboration with the Technology Strategy Board to commercialise 3Rs technologies. In 2013, we committed \u00c2\u01418 million for research and training, worked with 48 companies from across the globe on data sharing initiatives and increased the number of journals endorsing our reporting guidelines from 176 to 335. Our 3Rs strategy addresses major scientific and business challenges including translating research into economic growth, tackling serious diseases and reducing drug attrition. At its core is a commitment to minimise animal use and suffering and it is this which makes the NC3Rs unique. Animal research will continue to be one of the most contentious issues in science. This was certainly the case in 2004 when the NC3Rs was launched. Since then, as a result of our work, there has been a shift in the level of scientific engagement in the 3Rs and the ethos around animal research has started to change. The key challenge now is maintaining this momentum at a time when budgets are tight. The landscape continues to evolve and in 2014 we are planning a ten year forward look to examine the role of the NC3Rs in an environment that is very different to where we started. We will continue to work hard to ensure that the NC3Rs stays at the forefront of delivering a 3Rs agenda that addresses societal concerns about animal use and supports the health and wealth of the nation.

I left the house in the morning and returned in the evening, spending the day walking in the city where I\u2019ve lived for most of my life. Going Home, A Walk through Fifty Years of Occupation celebrates the life of ordinary people who, despite all the hardships, have managed to persevere, raise families, start businesses and go on with their life adapting to all the complications of a foreign rule that is more in the nature of a colonization than an occupation, one that hopes to replace one people with another on their land with all that this entails. This makes it all the more important to assert life by celebrating it through writing\nPenny: My book, Companions in Conflict, Animals in Occupied Palestine, also values the everyday and explores how our daily life and its moments of joy and sadness intertwine with what can be characterised as everyday violence.

"). For simplicity, this particular calculation assumes that all sulfuric acid reacts with calcium carbonate, which is reasonable, particularly for the northern rivers in which carbonate weathering constitutes much more than half and up to >90% of the weathering budget. We define \\({\\mathrm{pH}}_{{\\mathrm{SO}}_4}\\) as the pH of a solution that results from the addition of sulfuric acid with concentration \\(\\left[{\\mathrm{SO}}_4^{2 -} \\right]\\) to a calcium-carbonate-buffered solution with an initial pH noted as pH0. From equation (25), we recall that for a calcium-carbonate-buffered solution at equilibrium (that is, at \u03a9cal\u2009= 1), we have:\n$$a_{{\\rm{H}}^ + ,0} = \\frac{{K_2}}{{K_{{\\rm{sp}}}}}a_{{\\rm{Ca}}^{2 + },0}a_{{\\rm{HCO}}_3^ - ,0}$$\n$$a_{{\\rm{H}}^ + ,0} = \\frac{{K_2}}{{K_{\\rm{sp}}}}\\gamma _{\\rm{Ca}^{2 + },0}\\left[ {\\rm{Ca}}^{2 +} \\right]_0\\gamma _{{\\rm{HCO}}_3^ - ,0}\\left[{\\rm{HCO}}_3^ -\\right]_0$$\nwhere the subscript 0 denotes the quantities before the addition of sulfuric acid.

One state legislator has plans to introduce a new gun law in the opening session on January 9, ensuring the bill would not get lost in the rest of the business of the state as the year progresses. Despite the veto of a similar bill by Governor Jan Brewer last year, those in support of allowing guns on campuses feel confident that this year\u2019s bill will get the governor\u2019s blessings.\nWhy Guns on Campus?\nThe issue of allowing guns on university and community college campuses has been a hot-button topic since the shooting at Virginia Tech University in 2007 left 33 dead, including students, faculty members, and the shooter. According to AZ Central, Arizona lawmakers began introducing gun bills that following year, stating trained gun owners would provide another layer of protection for colleges throughout the state. The recent Arizona shootings in 2011 by former Pima Community College student Jared Loughner, who wounded and killed dozens of people at a shopping mall, including US Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, have further fueled the fire of these gun movements.\nCurrently, Arizona law allows individual schools to make the decision of whether to allow guns on their campuses, although none of the colleges in the state allow weapons on campus at this time.\n\u201cA gun-free zone really becomes self-defense-free zones,\u201d Arizona State Senator Ron Gould told My FOX Phoenix. \u201cLaw-abiding citizens are the only ones who follow the"

When asked why he had built the castle, Leedskalnin would vaguely answer it was for his \u201cSweet Sixteen\u201d.\nAllegedly, Leedskalnin used the principles of magnetism and leverage to move the large stones and completed the structure without the use of modern machinery or help from anyone else.\nEdward Leedskalnin built Coral Castle by himself, in secret, using hand tools.

"about the Capitol insurrection\nTemple defeats No. 1 Houston 56-55<s> Trump aide Meadows ordered to testify in election probe\nBy Kate Brumback, AP Posted on October 26, 2022\nFILE \u2013 White House chief of staff Mark Meadows speaks with reporters outside the White House, Oct. 26, 2020, in Washington. A judge has ordered former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to travel to Atlanta to testify before a special grand jury that\u2019s investigating whether then-President Donald Trump and his allies illegally tried to influence the state\u2019s 2020 election. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)\nA judge on Wednesday ordered former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to testify before a special grand jury that\u2019s investigating whether President Donald Trump and his allies illegally tried to influence Georgia\u2019s 2020 election.\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis opened the investigation early last year into actions taken by Trump and others to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Meadows is one of several associates and advisers of the Republican former president whose testimony Willis has sought.\nBecause Meadows doesn\u2019t live in Georgia, Willis, a Democrat, had to use a process that involved getting a judge where he lives in South Carolina to order him to appear. First, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who\u2019s overseeing the special grand jury, signed off on the petition, certifying that Meadows was a \u201cnecessary and material witness.\u201d\nNow, Circuit Court Judge Edward Miller in Pickens County, South Carolina, has honored McBurney\u2019s finding and ordered Meadows to testify, Willis spokesman Jeff DiSantis confirmed.\nMeadows attorney James Bannister could not immediately be reached for comment.\nWillis has been fighting similar battles \u2014 mostly with success \u2014 in courts around the country as she seeks to compel Trump allies to testify. An appeals court in Texas has indicated it may not recognize the validity of the Georgia summonses for potential witnesses who live there, and U."
". The whole \u2018festival\u2019 is more like a party. Matt Taibbi explains that while interviewing Bannon could be a worthwhile exercise, this was not the place.\nThe whole idea of a \u201cNew Yorker Festival\u201d is an abomination that no working journalist could be involved in without puking. I had to have it explained to me twice. It\u2019s basically a horrifically overpriced intellectual amusement park, where you get to pay $79 to watch Andy Borowitz genuflect before Adam Schiff, and another $79 to watch Jeffrey Toobin do the same with Sally Yates \u2014 probably talking all about Trump, of course, which is ironic, because for $79, you can attend a panel called \u201cTrump, Inc.\u201d that stars Felix Sater and Michael Avenatti talking about \u201cthe man and his money.\u201d A lunch tour with Calvin Trillin costs you $249, while \u201cmaking sense of the madness\u201d with poor Chris Hayes is a bleacher seat at $59.\nA bunch of people agreeing with each other, over food. As even New Yorker staffer Malcolm Gladwell noted, that\u2019s not an ideas festival, it\u2019s a dinner party.\nIt\u2019s a naked money-suck and an admirably transparent effort to turn Manhattanite Trump anxiety into lots of cash. In this context, the recruitment of the hated Bannon as one of these overpriced bearded-lady booths feels a lot less like journalism and a lot more like a particularly revolting new form of commerce.\nAs a reporter, I absolutely want to interview Steve Bannon. I\u2019ve got questions about a lot of the stuff in the Wolff book, and then also about how he conned reporters like me into thinking Trump was actually courting black voters in August and September of 2016, when what he was actually doing was baiting us into ridiculing the idea that Republican voters were interested in racial reconciliation.\nBannon understood that there was a big chunk of voters out there who would be more annoyed by East Coast press caricatures of them as racist hicks than they would be concerned about Trump\u2019s actual racism. The plan worked, and Trump recovered in the polls during the widely"

Vezina - images & text \u00a9 1999\nThe Cassiopeia is one of the many nuclear-powered space cargoes used by Intercorps to ship finished goods and equipment to colonies in the Solar System. The 1/100 scale ship was designed and built as a 3rd year project for the School of Design at the University of Montreal. The vessel was realized by a team of three students, Alain Gadbois, Vincent Bedard and Daniel Lacroix, over a period of two months.\nDESIGNING THE Cassiopeia\nThe project's main goal was to design a believable vessel while applying techniques learned at the school. To this end, a number of elements were set down from the beginning to guide the overall look of the space ship.\nCargo Pods: all cargo pods are standardized. They are space-worthy and can be ferried to and from orbit by an hypothetical second-generation space shuttle.\nStructure: the core of the ship is a simple triangular truss. Additional truss elements can be added to the design to lengthen the vessel if required. All ship systems are attached to the truss: propulsion, reaction mass tanks, maneuver engine clusters, etc. The crew modules, communication/sensor towers and auxiliary craft hangars are placed in the center of the ship.\nPropulsion: When the ship was designed (1984), the only reasonable means to propel such a vessel was nuclear. The crew section is thus placed well in front of the engines, with the reaction mass tanks placed in between to serve as additional shielding. One must note"

", had been well enough to care about style, the physician thinks, holding onto a deep, unsatisfying breath. Now he must call the next of kin. The only phone number belongs to the man\u2019s sister. When she answers, he reveals only that her brother is in the emergency department and he\u2019s critically ill. A chilled silence follows, but words are accumulating meaning, gaining a charge. The physician braces for a storm of grief. \u201cI need to find a ride. The legs don\u2019t work too good,\u201d the sister finally says, unexpectedly calm.\nThe physician sighs sweet relief. \u201cTake your time. We\u2019ll wait.\u201d\nNurses close off the room. The emergency department teems with life, making it a more charitable space for viewing the body than the sterile tranquility of the basement morgue. The physician scrambles to catch up with the many patients lost on his radar during the long code. He\u2019s also haunted by the horde of people camping in the waiting room for a bed.\nAn hour later she calls back. \u201cHow is he?\u201d\nDeceit aches. The physician bites his tongue. The years have taught him that news of sudden death demands intimacy, awkward and ill fitting as it may be. Over the phone it can feel like bumping against a darkness where some objects are fragile and others wired with explosives.\n\u201cIt would be easier if we can talk face to face,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI\u2019m on my way.

"that of Harun Farocki. In the second half of the 1960\u2019s they both formed the backbone of the Projektgruppe Sch\u00fclerfilm, an initiative of Berlin students building on the leftist intellectual legacy by combining militant cinema and Brechtian didacticism. After their studies, they continued to make a number of films together, and consequently co-founded the Filmkritik magazine as an outlet for their cinephile enthusiasm. But it was only a matter of time before their ways parted: \u201cFarocki comes from Eisenstein, and I come from Rossellini. He is very fond of montage, I am more interested in life\u201d. Although they are both exploring a critical-essayistic perspective, Bitomsky considers documentary film as an instrument for articulation rather than for deconstruction. So, each film he has been making since the 1970\u2019s provides some sort of map, its routes leading us through unruly territories, covering themes such as memory, history, technology and image culture. In this fourth installment of the DISSENT ! series a selection of Bitomsky\u2019s films will serve as the starting point for a conversation on cinema, documentary practice, image and reality.\nThe talk follows after the screening of:\nHartmut Bitomsky & Heiner M\u00fchlenbrock - Deutschlandbilder\n1983-84, 35mm, 60', b&w, German spoken, English subtitles.\n\u201cThe film is composed of excerpts from more than 30 documentary films that were made and shown in the period between 1933 and 1945. The documentary films present a clean and self-confident Germany and a people of nature lovers, who respect its traditions, is devoted to progress and has an appreciation for beauty. This was something the Nazis particularly liked; they had a pronounced need for beauty. They loved films and they made ample use of them. Most of the films deal with work, leisure and work again. They indulge in a certain kind of populism, one that casts a look of understanding at the simple man. In this way they function like a reversed plebiscite: the regime confirms its people because they show themselves to be devoted and able and because"

"commercial ships discreetly for military purposes, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece, and while these might not be super high-end platforms ready to face off with major navies, they definitely reflect real threats in other capacities.\nThe exporting of sea-launched drone capabilities to nefarious customers and especially its militant proxy forces is really a bigger issue than Iran displaying the capability itself. The fact is these drones could be launched from pretty much any ship, not just obvious 'drone carriers,' and even be employed against other ships. This can make attributing the source of attacks very challenging, as well as interdicting the launch platforms prior to deploying the drones.\nOne of the Iranian drones used in the unveiling ceremony of the Iranian Navy's \"drone-carrier\" division flying above auxiliary ship Delvar. MEHR News Agency\nThat category of threats has been a growing friction point in the Middle East as of late, and The War Zone routinely highlights the fact that a low-intensity maritime drone war is already underway between Iran and Israel. Another drone event in Israel's maritime zone just occurred. The fear of proliferation of these systems, as well as cheap cruise missiles, has led to the possibility of a previously unthinkable alliance between the Arab states and Israel that could include a shared air defense network focused on early warning, tracking, and engaging these threats. The drones' small signatures and their ability to fly low, and in some cases slow, over great distances, along with their low cost, which allows for 'flocks' to be deployed against a single target area, even by non-state actors, make them an especially potent air defense challenge. The fact that they can be launched from pretty much any ship complicates things considerably. Israel is already preparing for such a contingency and the U.S. has major concerns about similar threats emanating from beyond its shores.\nMeanwhile, Israel, which pioneered the 'suicide drone' concept, is also equipping its own ships with similar, albeit far more advanced systems.\nNeedless to say, Iran is evidently making prominent strides in indigenous weapons and capabilities development. How exactly this equipment will be used"
"memories were, of Packanack Lake. Nevertheless, a separate quip (equally sympathetic) a rose during rehearsal, at the point where the live ensemble wait out a period of about 1'45\", when I closed my eyes, and Pam wondered aloud if I hadn't fallen asleep. While there is a kind of dark, diaphanous mystery to the prerecorded mix, I find it truly, profoundly relaxing. The rehearsals have gone better and better; and while the chance aspect of just how the live quartet and the fixed media coordinate means that it's never quite the same twice, I find it some kind of marvelous, how apt the chance interplay always turns out. Not really sure how I managed that. (No, I had not fallen asleep.)\nBetween Kurosawa's Scarecrow and Mistaken for the Sacred, the surface similarity is of course the combination of live instruments with fixed media. Chief among many differences, probably, are 1) the distinct character and materials in the fixed media, 2) the fact that the entrances of the ensemble are fairly free in Kurosawa's Scarecrow, but the alignment of the two elements is fairly strict in M. for the S., and 3) the writing for the instruments is busier and quirkier in Mistaken for the Sacred. Of the three pieces we rehearsed yesterday evening, then, we needed to train a bit more attention upon a few passages in M. for the S. Both of these pieces are experiencing significant artistic gains as we work them up now, with the benefit of the previous performances.\nTomorrow, I have a rehearsal with Louise Mundinger of the Voluntary on \"Beautiful Savior.\" It has got to be ten years or more since last I played the clarinet at St Paul's on Tremont Street.\nAnd today, in Ten Years Ago\n:: 9 October 2008 ::\nStarted sketching a fresh number of White Nights on the bus this morning.\nWell, I am (at present) jiggered as to which number that might have been.

It seemed logical, then, to devote much of the succeeding issue to current books on liberalism.\nLiberalism from the outset, as the French political thinker Pierre Manent has reminded us, was a body of thought set against the Christian church. While it was ostensibly conceived as a means to weaken the political influence of the church and thus avoid armed religious conflict, its relegation of moral concerns to the private sphere has effectively emptied the public square of any meaning, any collective aspiration, or any substantive"

"dose of 0.06, 0.08 or 0.1 mg/kg ALT-836 or placebo. Blood samples were taken for pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity measurements. Safety was assessed by adverse events, vital signs, ECGs, laboratory, coagulation and pulmonary function parameters. Results Pharmacokinetic analysis showed a dose dependent exposure to ALT-836 across the infusion range of 0.06 to 0.1 mg/kg. No anti-ALT-836 antibody response was observed in the study population during the trial. No major bleeding episodes were reported in the ALT-836 treated patients. The most frequent adverse events were anemia, observed in both placebo and ALT-836 treated patients, and ALT-836 dose dependent, self-resolved hematuria, which suggested 0.08 mg/kg as an acceptable dose level of ALT-836 in this patient population. Conclusions Overall, this study showed that ALT-836 could be safely administered to patients with sepsis-induced ALI/ARDS.

My last update here was an embarrassingly long time ago in January 2017. So let me address that!\nTaproot was still very much a side project throughout 2017 and into early 2018, though we did continue to take small steps forward. Karen Unland and I officially incorporated the business in 2017, for instance. For the most part we continued with our original membership-based model and we did publish a number of high-quality, original stories that explored questions posed by our members. We also built an award-winning microsite for the municipal election that fall.\nIn early 2018 we made a short-lived foray into chatbots which we thought might mesh well with our curiosity-driven approach. It didn\u2019t work out (though I still think the idea has merit and could work some day). One of the key things we learned during that time was the importance of \"priming the pump\" for curiosity. So in mid-2018 we launched our first official roundup, the Tech Roundup.

Wyatt\nScience - general, Popular sciences, Biological sciences\nHow animals behave is crucial to their survival and reproduction. The application of new molecular tools such as DNA fingerprinting and genomics is causing a revolution in the study of animal behaviour, while developments in computing and image analysis allow us to investigate behaviour in ways never previously possible. By combining these with the traditional methods of observation and experiments, we are now learning more about animal behaviour than ever before. In this Very Short Introduction Tristram D. Wyatt discusses how animal behaviour has evolved, how behaviours develop in each individual (considering the interplay of genes, epigenetics, and experience), how we can understand animal societies, and how we can explain collective behaviour such as swirling flocks of starlings. Using lab and field studies from across the whole animal kingdom, he looks at mammals, butterflies, h"

We determined the role of the cis-acting element in viral replication by comparing recombinant viruses with the cis-acting element replaced with other sequences. Recombinant virus with the simian CMV counterpart replicated efficiently in human foreskin fibroblasts, as well as wild-type virus. In contrast, replacement with the murine CMV counterpart caused inefficient MIE gene transcription, RNA splicing, MIE and early viral gene expression, and viral DNA replication. To determine which nucleotides in the cis-acting element are required for efficient MIE gene transcription and splicing, we constructed mutations within the cis-acting element in the context of a recombinant virus. While mutations in the cis-acting element have only a minor effect on in vitro transcription, the effects on viral replication are major. The nucleotides at -10 and -9 in the cis-acting element relative to the transcription start site (+1) affect efficient MIE gene transcription and splicing at early times after infection. The cis-acting element also acts as a cis-repression sequence when the viral IE86 protein accumulates in the infected cell. We demonstrate that the cis-acting element has an essential role in viral replication.\nAB - The promoter of the major immediate-early (MIE) genes of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), also"

His wealthy family has his entire life already mapped out for him, and his beloved music isn\u2019t part of it. And being a gay man is DEFINITELY not part of the picture. Taking off on a solo road trip without telling his family is the only act of rebellion he can bring himself to make, since he believes he\u2019s trapped into doing what his father wants. But when he meets Jasper and gets to know him, he begins to realize that maybe he\u2019s braver than he believed at first.\nI loved Jasper, and while it took a little longer for me to warm up to Liam, by the end I was pretty proud of him and the way he was able to face up to his jerk of a father. I would have loved to learn more about Jasper, though. We learn how much he loves his family home, but we don\u2019t find out why he\u2019s alone there \u2013 no parents, family left.

"Respect of the Species below it,Genus speciale as Seneca calls it, Epist. LVIII. a Genus: So those Magistrates, in Respect to their Inferiors, are publick Persons, but in Respect to their Superiors, are but private Persons.2 All the civil Power, that such Magistrates have, is so subject to the Sovereign,Averroes, V. Metaphys. com. 6. that whatever they do against his Will is done without Authority, and consequently ought to be considered only as a private Act. In a Word, according to the Maxim of Philosophers, which may be here applied, all Order necessarily relates to something that is First; and they, who think otherwise, seem to me to introduce such a State of Things as the Ancients fabled to have been in Heaven before there was a sovereign Majesty, when the lesser Gods did not submit to Jupiter. That Order3 which I have spoken of, and \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc \u03c2, Subordination, is not only apprehended by common Sense, as appears by the excellent4 Sayings which we find on that Subject in Authors both Pagan and Christian; but it is also supported by divine Authority;1 Peter ii. 13. for St. Peter bids us be subject to the King, otherwise than to Magistrates; to the King as supreme, that is5 without Exception, but only to those Things which GOD directly commands, who approves, and not forbids, our bearing of an Injury.Rom. xiii. 1. But to Magistrates as deputed by the King, that is deriving their Authority from him. And when St. Paul would have every Soul be subject to the higher Powers, he also included inferior Magistrates. Neither do we find among the Hebrews, where there were so many Kings regardless of all Right both divine and human, that any inferior Magistrates, among whom there were many pious and valiant Persons, ever assumed the Liberty to resist their Kings by Force, unless they had a special Commission from GOD,[111] who has a sovereign Power over Kings themselves; on the contrary,1 Sam. xv. 30. what the Duty of great Men"

Sadly, sometimes those people who would do such a thing can be your family or friends. It\u2019s saddening that they are the first to laugh at you when you\u2019re feeling low. Their reason is that they get to laugh at your situation because they are family. However, there\u2019s a huge difference between having fun and offending actions. It\u2019s even more hurtful when they comment on things about you even though they know what you\u2019ve been through.\nPhoto: Pexels/Keira Burton\nAnother hurtful part about such jokes is the invalidating comments. They\u2019ll tell you that you\u2019re overreacting and you are being a big killjoy. One of the most laughed-at matters is a person\u2019s physical appearance. Immature and narcissistic people have a lot of jokes about this \u2014 even if it\u2019s their wife. MandyTate35246 shared her story on Reddit that involves her husband\u2019s family and friends.

Surprisingly in Singapore today, many locals still consider Jurong West to be that \u2018Paradise\u2019. It seems to them that venturing any further than that would result in falling off the map into the Milky Way. Therefore, I present to you ladies & gentlemen, this tiny corner of Jurong West known as Westwood.\nAbout Westwood\nLocated 3 bus stops away from Boon Lay MRT or 15 minutes by foot, Westwood neighbourhood was first completed around 1997 and sees a mixture of 99-years Terrace & Semi-Detached houses. The neighbourhood is made up of Westville & Westwood Park, they are currently served by a SHELL petrol kiosk, Gek Poh Community Centre, Gek Poh neighbourhood mall & Jurong West Police Headquarters.\nSBS Bus services 181(Feeder Bus from Boon Lay Interchange) & 185 stop directly along Jurong West Avenue 5 and the latter takes you to Holland Village(Buona Vista bus terminal).

As with any other landed estate, there comes a period in time where residents begin to relocate. Many of the first batch of residents here have been replaced by new owners(or even 3rd owners) and one can easily tell from the amount of construction & renovation work going on when passing by newly sold houses.

However, as Patricio stated in his 29 January 2016 email announcing Mar\u00eda's appointment: \"Mar\u00eda Sefidari will accept an appointment to the Board of Trustees, stepping into the third community-nominated seat.\" As has been recently discussed, all community-nominated and affiliate-nominated Trustees are ultimately appointed to the Board, which is why the word \"appointment\" appears in his message. So, as it stands now, Mar\u00eda is holding the third community-nominated seat previously held by user:Doc James. As a result, I plan to revert these edits to the Board page to accurately reflect where things stand now. Again, I respect your right to explain why this should be changed, but I do not believe anyone is helped by implying the change you are seeking has already been made, when in fact it has not. I hope you understand the desire to keep this page accurate. --Gregory Varnum (WMF) (talk) 20:43, 28 February 2016 (UTC)\nThis is the fairy tale those that ditched the proper elected board member without any valid explanation, thus kicking the community in the face, gave as an excuse for their illegitimate deeds, to cover up their fault.

The field pennycress genome sequencing and assembly were performed using reads obtained from a combination of sequencing technologies: Illumina Hiseq and Oxford Nanopore (Table S1). First, paired-end libraries were prepared, and short reads (~\u2009150\u2009bp) generated using Illumina HiSeq platforms. Genome size and heterozygosity of pennycress were estimated using k-mer statistics [22] based on the HiSeq reads. Next, the Nanopore library (30\u201380\u2009kb) was sequenced on R9.4 flow cells using the PromethION DNA sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, NY, USA). For the Nanopore data, reads with mean quality scores >\u20097 were retained and then assembled into contigs by the program wtdbg ver.2.4 [54].

The musculoskeletal tissues include muscle cells, connective tissue matrix, inter- and extracellular fluids, interstitial cells, and nerves. The data reviewed suggest that muscle cells and connective tissue matrix play relatively large roles in electrically stimulating the generation of electric potentials in muscle tissue. Interstitial cells are primarily responsible for mediating the spread of these electric signals between muscle cells. The nerves are important for the initiation of these electric signals and the neural conduction that follows.Project: Connected Vehicles and the Challenge for the Automotive Industry\ninNovo Networking\nDuring the last years, a lot of research has been done on the topic of \u201cconnected vehicles\u201d.

Akin to \u2018GTA: Vice City\u2019, these films are set in the South, have fast cars, lots of gunplay and while the place looks nice, deep down the place\u2019s nature is one that is vicious and violent. Besides, they exist in the same shared universe and that is always fun. Taryn has a poster of \u2018Malibu Express\u2019 hanging at her place and discusses the main hero\u2019s (played by Darby Hinton) sexual prowess. Such a connection is enough for me, I mean, \u2018Red Scorpion 2\u2019 didn\u2019t even have that much of a callback to the original movie.\nWhat is more, as usual for Sidaris\u2019 movies, the film does indeed look good; Hawaii never fails to charm. Surprisingly enough, the 80s pop title song is catchy as well.\nAs for the nudity, \u2018Hard Ticket\u2019 is not a soft-core porn the way \u2018Malibu Express\u2019 is \u2013 I mean, really, \u2018Express\u2019 has way more sex scenes, so much that you kind of forget you are supposed to be watching an action movie. Whilst the girls in \u2018Hard Ticket\u2019 show lots of skin and Sidaris was never a prude. At any rate, this movie is way more well balanced when compared to his other works. Still, I prefer \u2018Seven\u2019 and consider it the man\u2019s masterpiece, while the \u2018Hard Ticket\u2019 holds the second place. The movie is so eighties it hurts, in twenty first century it appears to be more of a parody of the era\u2019s quirks than anything else. If there ever is a museum of action movies, \u2018Hard Ticket to Hawaii\u2019 definitely belongs in there. Besides, along with other movies of Andy Sidaris, it is a definite collection of 80\u2019s Playboy playmates.\nTruth to be told, this movie is full of bullets, explosions, babes, bikinis and there is also a giant snake, that somehow ties into the plot. Then again, whom am I kidding, speaking of that \u2018plot\u2019, whilst it is virtually non-existent?\nIs \u2018Hard Ticket to Hawaii\u2019 a good movie on par with the best 80s flicks"

The population was 19,851 at the 2010 census.\nThe farmers who first moved to what is now Selden in the mid-18th century referred to the area as \u201cWestfield\u201d (or sometimes as Westfields). One of the better known early residents was Captain Daniel Roe (1740-1820), who fought in the French and Indian War and served as a captain in the Revolutionary War, and for whom Captain Daniel Roe Highway is named. Roe built a house in Selden along Middle Country Road before the Revolutionary War. Roe is buried in a small family cemetery south of Middle Country Road behind the Old Westfield shopping center.\nFrom The Diary of Captain Daniel Roe, 1806-08 (1904), caption reads: \u201cSchool house near home of Capt. Daniel Roe. Near the tree, at the right, tradition says the Tory Captain Richard Miller fell from his horse in 1776.\u201d\nRoe sided with the Patriots in the lead-up to the Revolutionary War. In the fall of 1776, Roe was assigned to lead a raid against the Tory and Hessian detachment near Selden led by his cousin Richard Miller. Miller was a wanted man, and Roe himself had pledged 10 pounds of the bounty offered for Miller\u2019s capture. When Miller rode right by Roe\u2019s house in uniform, he was confronted by Roe\u2019s men and ordered to dismount. Instead, Miller fired his pistol and turned to flee, whereupon he was shot by the militiamen. Miller was then carried into Roe\u2019s house, where he died.\nA school district for the Westfield area was first created in 1815, carved out of the districts for New Village (now Centereach) and Coram. Originally named District 25, it was renumbered as District 12 in 1842, which it remained until the formation of the Middle Country Central School District in 1957"

"swabbed their noses. We observed a reduction of ACE2 in their nasal cells, the main point of entry for the virus into the body, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 would have fewer opportunities to infect these cells.\nFinally, since UDCA is widely used in clinical practice, we examined existing data to compare COVID outcomes among people taking UDCA for their liver conditions with outcomes among people not taking UDCA. We found that people taking UDCA were less likely to develop moderate, severe or critical COVID than those who did not receive the drug.\nWhat could this all mean?\nUDCA has been on the market for 30 years, and is very safe, with few side effects. In addition, the drug is off-patent, inexpensive, and easy to manufacture, store and administer (it\u2019s taken in tablet form), rendering it convenient to deploy during an outbreak.\nAlthough our results suggest that UDCA could protect against COVID, this study is not a clinical trial and only offers data supporting this hypothesis. The next step will be to confirm our findings in a large randomised clinical trial. We don\u2019t support the use of UDCA for COVID until appropriate policy based on robust clinical evidence is available.\nIn the future, UDCA would not replace current COVID treatments or highly effective vaccinations, but may be able to expand our arsenal of weapons against the virus. It could offer an alternative strategy which is not dependent on the immune system or subject to immune escape because of viral mutations.\nTeresa Brevini, PhD candidate, Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge and Fotios Sampaziotis, UKRI Future Leaders Fellow, Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge<s> September 5, 2015 September 5, 2015 Rafael Nadal Fans\nRafa Roundup: What happened to Rafael Nadal?\nScreenshot: Eurosport\nU.S. Open 2015: Rafael Nadal exits Flushing Meadows after humbling defeat (via CNN)\nIt just hasn\u2019t been Rafael Nadal\u2019s year.\nThe Spaniard crashed out of the U.S. Open in the third"
"and patient outcomes. The approaches include the application of advanced imaging and/or preoperative and intraoperative mapping for neurosurgical planning and resection. Bennett et al. compared preoperative functional MRI and intraoperative direct electrical stimulation to functional cortical parcellation predicted by the Human Connectome Project. The role of preoperative mapping for localization of language areas in patients who are not eligible for awake craniotomy is discussed by Raffa et al. A similar topic in relation to children is addressed by Krieg et al., who describe the application of technologies including MRI tractography and navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation for preoperative identification of eloquent areas in younger children for whom functional MRI and direct intraoperative stimulation are not practical. The effect of technology-driven procedures is the topic of the study by Lu et al., who assessed the effect of MR-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy on neuronal connectivity in a series of essential tremor patients.\nAnother important theme of this Neurosurgical Focus issue is the identification and application of prognostic factors for neurosurgical and treatment outcomes.

So, with IMSA and the Michelin GT coming back for 2016, the folks at VIR took a major step to insure the racing would be secure and any concerns for the surface would be behind them.\nThey shut down during one of their busy summer months and paved it again. All of July plus a little more was spent resurfacing the entire course. The job this time has everyone pleased. Michelin and Continental have already done tire testing on the surface in advance of the Michelin GT / Continental weekend scheduled for August 26-28.

"but because it was seen as difficult, which is a nice sentiment.\nHBO Max announced just days before release that the movie would be available on Thursday, not Friday, as part of a \u201cspecial preview event.\u201d\nLet\u2019s be about what works in the campaign.\nIt focuses on Paul Atreides, which makes sense given the entire story revolves around that character, but it doesn\u2019t go too hard in the paint in setting him up as a white savior out to rule the native people and their lands. Nor does it spend too much time tipping its hat toward Paul\u2019s role as a prophet or Christ-like figure. Instead he\u2019s a young man put in a rough situation and making the best of it and trying to fulfill his destiny as well as his father\u2019s expectations for him.\nIt highlights bits of comedy \u2013 or at least levity \u2013 that are wholly missing from the source novel or previous adaptations. Those especially come through in some of the scenes featuring Isaac\u2019s Duke Leto Atreides and Duncan Idaho, played by Jason Momoa. With such a weighty product being pitched to audiences, it\u2019s good to include a few lighter moments added by screenwriters Ross, Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts to make it a bit more attractive.\nIt keeps the scale both massive and human. This is addressed in one of the interviews linked above, but the marketing nicely balances showing how big the movie is while also making it clear the story hinges not on those huge ships or the grand, detailed buildings we see but on the characters walking around and through them. That helps communicate that the audience won\u2019t be overwhelmed or wonder who they\u2019re being asked to care about or why they should care.\nWith those all in mind there\u2019s one thing that strikes me as odd about the marketing.\nNamely, the message sent by Villeneuve and others that the fate of the second movie being made at all hinges on audiences going to theaters in huge numbers to see this one.\nIt\u2019s odd, especially in this age of franchises being central to studio success, that there would be any contingency placed on the second installment, especially given the admission that this is only the first half of the first of multiple stories that could be told.

For example, in FeO crystal, some of the Fe2+ ions are missing from the crystal lattice.\nTo maintain electrical neutrality, twice the number of other Fe2+ ions in the crystal is oxidized to Fe3+ ions. In such cases, the overall number of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions is less than the O2- ions. It was experimentally found that the general formula of ferrous oxide is FexO, where x ranges from 0.93 to 0.98.\nCalculate the number of atoms in a fee unit cell.\nNumber of atoms in a fee unit cell,\n= \\(\\frac { { N }_{ c } }{ 8 }\\) + \\(\\frac { { N }_{ f } }{ 2 }\\)\n= \\(\\frac { 8 }{ 8 } \\) + \\(\\frac { 6 }{ 2 } \\) = 1 + 3 = 4\nExplain AAAA and ABABA and ABCABC type of three-dimensional packing with the help of a neat diagram.\n1.

"y payments per acre have been high \u2014 and farm size has increased the most.\nPhoto: fearlessvk\nFarms have gotten bigger over the last two decades, much bigger. The question the federal Economic Research Service has tried to answer is why. Have federal crop payments sped the concentration of land and the explosion of mega-farms?\nThis isn\u2019t just an academic question for rural communities. Andrew Isserman at the University of Illinois has found that the most prosperous rural communities have high numbers of farms and larger farm employment. The trend in much of rural America, however, is toward big time agriculture. These are all questions vital for rural America \u2014 even if they are rarely the subject of farm bill debates.\nHog finishing operations are two to three times what they were just in the early 1990s, according to the ERS\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Nigel Key and Michael Roberts . Broiler operations have doubled in size over twenty years. There were fewer than 600 dairy herds of more than a thousand cows in 1992. Today, there are over 1,400.\nThe same was true with cropland. In 1982, farms with at least 1,000 acres used 19 percent of the land used for agriculture. By 2002, these large farms covered 48 percent of agricultural land.\nThe common economic explanation for this kind of concentration is efficiency. Larger farms are better able to automate. As agricultural labor shifts to other areas of the economy, farmers have substituted machines for men \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and that only works on larger operations.\nIn 1982 and 1987, medium sized farms (150-400 acres) accounted for more of the nation\u2019s cropland than farms of any other size. Since 1992, U.S. cropland has become concentrated on mega-farms of 1000 acres or more.\nBut machinery and efficiency may not be the only reason farms have grown so much larger. The ERS also finds a relationship between land concentration and federal crop subsidies. Key and Roberts discovered a strong statistical relationship between cropland concentration growth"
"ries in non-ceremonial orders of dress, except for the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) who wore it in Rifle green, and the Scots Guards who wear peaked forage caps instead, albeit with a diced band. The diced bands were usually in red and white but the toories on top could be red, Royal blue or black according to regiment. For a period from 1868 to 1902, the Glengarry was adopted as an undress cap for ordinary duty and walking out dress for most British soldiers. A cap described in a 1937 amendment to the Dress Regulations for the Army as \"similar in shape to the Glengarry\" became the Universal Pattern Field Service Cap of the British Army in World War II. In the 1930s, Percy Sillitoe, the Chief Constable of the City of Glasgow Police, replaced the traditional police helmet with peaked caps featuring black and white chequered cap bands based on those featured on the military's Glengarry headdress, popularly known as the 'Sillitoe Tartan'. The diced band was subsequently widely adopted by British and other police forces around the world on their caps. Gordon Highlanders Glengarry The Gordons wore a dark blue glengarry with red ,white and very dark green dice with a red toorie. The Gordon Highlanders were a line infantry regiment of the British Army that existed for 113 years, from 1881 until 1994 when it was amalgamated with the Queen's Own Highlanders (Seaforth and Camerons) to form the Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons) In March 2006 they became the 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland (4 SCOTS) Their cap badge comprised of a white metal badge, with a stags head within a wreath of ivy, with a coronet and small scroll with the motto 'BYDAND' (Steadfast) Three officers of 1st Battalion The Gordon Highlanders photographed in France during the early months of the First World War\nscottish regiments<s> IL-7 and CCL19 expression in CAR-T cells improves immune"

"of COVID-19 Infection\nFear of getting infected by the COVID-19 was found as a significant predictor of depression, anxiety, and stress in a couple of studies,31,32,37 whereas relatives or friends being infected with the COVID-19 had also increased the level of anxiety.35 Safa et al32 reported that students severely tensed of being contacted with the COVID-19 infected individuals were at 3.5- and 2.75-times higher risk of being anxious and depressed, respectively, than the students who had no or minimal contract. Similarly, contact with the confirmed COVID-19 cases was reported to be at 4- and 3.17-times higher risk of getting stressed and anxious, respectively.31\nCOVID-19 Related Symptoms\nMental health sufferings were also increased when students reported experiencing the COVID-19 related symptoms. For example, Sayeed et al31 reported that experiencing one and more symptoms, and at least one symptom increased the risk of stress by 1.60 and 3.06 times; whereas it was 3.02 and 4.96 times, respectively, for anxiety. Also, another study found having the symptoms of fever, dry cough, fatigue, sore throat, difficulty breathing as the influential factors of mental disorders.37\nOther Risk Factors\nSome other factors also reported increasing the risk of psychological sufferings. Such as (i) losing part-time teaching job (that is, serving as a tutor),36 (ii) reporting lack of concentration on the study,32 (iii) being agitated more easily,32 (iv) fear of getting assaulted or humiliated on the way to the hospital or home,32 (v) worsening their financial condition,35,37 (vi) being dissatisfied with academic studies,34 (vi) having an inadequate food supply,37 (viii) being more exposed to the COVID-19 news in social media and mass media,37 (ix) being more active in recreational activities (ie, watching TV series, reading storybooks, online and offline gaming, etc.), (x) engaging in household chores,"

For example you don't know what some thing is before you have tried it (what is cold, how it feels to be sick or hurt). Maybe demons themselves hadn't emotions, but when they got hold of body or thing they got the taste of what feels to be \"alive or living\" and they got hooked. Now was they want to feel it again and be as lucky as the beings able to be alive, they try to get host through whom they can live through and feel all the glorious things of live.\nWhat kind of place is Gehenna?\nWell it could be nothingness and dull place, but I like to think it that there is nothingness but then there is desert and wilderness like in anime scene were Mephisto phones Amaimon who was in Gehenna slaughtering lesser demons.

"its sleep tracking setup based on the Withings Aura. Personally I was a fan of falling asleep to crashing waves and fading colored light, but that is no more. What you're left with is what Nokia calls a 'sleep sensing and home automation pad' and we are going to focus mainly on the sleep sensing side of things for this review.\nLooks-wise, this is the Aura sleep sensor albeit there's now a nicer, soft fabric finish that looks like it's going to get a lot less grubby than its predecessor. It measures in at 637mm long, 190mm wide and 5mm thick - you are simply not going to feel it underneath you when you're in bed. Nokia states it's tested the sensor on bed mattresses ranging in thickness from 10 to 40cm so it should cover most mattresses. But it is still one pad per person, so if you share your bed with someone else and they want to track their own sleep, you'll need to invest in a second pad.\nInside the Sleep's pad lies the tracking sensors and a microphone to detect snoring. There's just one USB power cable that needs to be plugged into the mains and if you do happen to still have the Aura light/speaker, you can still plug the Nokia Sleep into the back (plug it into the one on the far right of the Aura speaker).\nOnce you've slipped the sensor underneath the mattress or between your mattress and mattress topper (at about the position of where your chest lies) and plugged it in, your next step is downloading the Nokia Health Mate app. What proceeds is a pretty standard Bluetooth pairing process. You'll then need to enter data such as gender, weight and height before the calibration process starts. You'll know it's started because you'll hear a buzzing sound from the pad. It takes around 10-15 minutes to calibrate and you need to stay away from the bed while it goes through this process.\nAll that's left to do is to get some sleep time in and let the tracking magic begin.\nNokia Sleep: Sleep tracking features\n"
"is not the case at the moment.\nFor example, over the weekend a Victorian teenager was fined A$1,652 for leaving home to go for a driving lesson with her mother. Police said their activities were \u201cnon-essential travel\u201d.\nThe advice from New South Wales police at that time said such activities were fine in NSW. Victoria police have since withdrawn the fine.\nBut NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller told the ABC\u2019s Fran Kelly that in NSW you cannot travel to your holiday home unless it is \u201cessential\u201d. Victorians are told they can head to their holiday homes over Easter as long as they otherwise maintain strict quarantining on arrival.\nCoronavirus has seriously tested our border security. Have we learned from our mistakes?\nThese are just two examples in two states of a broader underlying problem that Americans would deem unconstitutionally \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d, a law invalid because it\u2019s not sufficiently clear.\nCalls for common sense do little to ease concerns that things are likely to worsen. The broad coronavirus containment and mitigation strategies might continue for many more months.\nRemember the Fitzgerald inquiry\nPerhaps we can learn from the landmark Fitzgerald inquiry into Queensland policing, more than three decades ago.\nThirty years on, the Fitzgerald Inquiry still looms large over Queensland politics\nThe inquiry identified widespread systemic corruption in police, politics and civil society. This inquiry represented a change in police accountability.\nThere is another, lesser-known or appreciated aspect of the Fitzgerald inquiry. It emphasised that police must have the consent of the community: police have to ensure their practices generate trust that people will be treated fairly and police discretion will be used appropriately.\nThese are standard issues in the policing scholarship.\nPandemic policing raises many issues that cut to the core of policing by consent.\nHow policing resources are mobilised and the decision-making processes and practices on the ground are vital. Just look at the confused circumstances of the disembarkation of the Ruby Princess cruise ship in Sydney, which has been a key cause of the spread of COVID-19 in NSW and beyond.\nThe Australian Border Force, NSW health authorities and NS"
"the typical sinkholes in the landscape. The turquoise spring ponds and bizarre waterfalls are also the results of this perpetual process.\nSince prehistoric times, rock has also been a raw material that people have made use of. In the Ice Age, flints were collected, in the Middle Ages bean ore was mined and today we use lime from the Swabian Alb in cement.\nUnderstanding the correlations between rocks, landscape and the history and culture of mankind means studying details. Many stone stories are waiting to be discovered. So keep your eyes open when hiking in the stunning UNESCO Global Geopark Swabian Alb.\nVolcanoes and meteorites\nWhere herds of sheep currently graze peacefully, millions of years ago mighty explosions of water vapour shook the earth. Today the volcanic vents are lovely to look at as cone-shaped mountains or as maars. They are a silent reminder of volcanism on the Alb.\nIn the same age, two meteorites found their way onto the territory of today's Alb and struck with a force that one can hardly imagine.

"of teacher educators, global education appeared as a starting point for education and teacher training. However, the discussions highlighted various tensions, for example in relation to the value base of global education, the nature of change and action. In teacher education, opportunities to address broad and complex themes were presented through, for example, dialogue, criticality and changing of perspectives, experiential learning, student encounters, and extensive collaboration. Challenges to the implementation of global education included a solid division of subjects, the ambiguity of global education, efficiency and lack of time, broad learning objectives, and formal learning environments. On the other hand, the introduction of critical thinking through subject didactics, a holistic approach to all teaching and the strengthening of the role of the educator in teacher education were also mentioned as examples. It is important to discuss global education and its goals both inside and outside teacher education and to co-operate in the wide-ranging implementation of global education.<s> Home Space Remote sensing\nA black and white view of Saturn shadowed by its rings [SCIENCE ART]\nby Tibi Puiu\nin Remote sensing, Space\nIn a dazzling new photo delivered by NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft, Saturn can be admired in new black and white perspective, as its southern reaches are draped in the shadow of the huge planet\u2019s rings.\nThe near-infrared photo was snapped on June 15 by the Cassini probe, a spacecraft launched in 1997 part of an international collaborative effort and which since its arrival in 2004 has been surveying Saturn and its satellites.

"uciary Integrity LLC, a consulting firm that helps investors find and minimize mutual fund and annuity fees.\nThe long-term impact of fees\nFees are one of the biggest drains on your retirement savings. On a $200,000 one-time investment, the difference between a 0.25 percent annual fee and a 1 percent annual fee totals over $210,000 after 30 years, assuming a 6% average annual return. If you pay a front-end load, a percentage of your initial investment goes toward that cost rather than into the fund, meaning that money doesn\u2019t make it into the market at all.\nTo keep fees low, look at expense ratios and load charges before you invest \u2014 never assume an investment is inexpensive, even if it is offered within a retirement account.

"REE 3-CONES AT THE TOP\nTyrell Williams, Western Oregon WR (6-3, 204). Williams was credited with the fastest 3-cone time in the NFL rookie class this spring at 6.55 seconds, though that time has been adjusted on his NFLDraftscout.com page to a still-snappy 6.74. Williams averaged 17 yards per catch last season for the Wolves (56 for 950) and scored eight TDs.\nDamiere Byrd, South Carolina WR (5-9, 173). Byrd had himself a heck of a pro day, completing a 6.60-second 3-cone as well as a missile-like 4.28-second 40-yard dash (which would have tied him for fastest player at the combine). Byrd snared 20 passes for 308 yards and three TDs in 2014. He got invited to the Medal of Honor Bowl, where he caught a touchdown.\nJustin Coleman, Tennessee CB (5-11, 185). The only one of these three invited to the combine, Coleman had a 6.61-second 3-cone to lead all Indy invitees, as well as a 3.98-second 20-yard dash (seventh at the combine). In 2014, Coleman had 42 tackles, four interceptions, and five passes broken up.\nAND THE ONE GUY WE SHOULD ALL ROOT FOR\nShane Wynn, Indiana WR (5-6, 167).

"of feathers to begin Euripides\u2019 long moan of a lamentation for the horrors of the war just ended. For that\u2019s what The Trojan Women is at heart: the agony of defeat articulated by women who\u2019ve had no part in their society\u2019s battle.\nIt is Hecuba, played with down-to-earth majesty by Petronia Paley, who does most of the articulating. In D. Nicholas Rudall\u2019s conversational translation, she argues with the young Greek officer (a nicely conflicted Andrew Long) who delivers the details of her people\u2019s enslavement. And when the gravity of their situation sinks in, she rails against the gods while a chorus of her subjects moans backup in aching harmonies devised by composer Lisa Bielawa.\nFueling their communal fury are Hecuba\u2019s mad, virginal daughter Cassandra (Opal Alladin), who\u2019ll now be a Greek general\u2019s whore, Andromache (Socorro Santiago), who has lost a husband and will soon lose a son to the slaughter, and an unrepentant Helen (Elizabeth Long), the self-serving siren over whom this war has been fought. Each will have her moment in the spotlight before returning focus to Hecuba, whose passionate lamentation is, after all, the stuff of legend.\nAkalaitis punctuates the grieving with quite a few startling tableaus\u0097soldiers holding a doomed boy aloft in an unnerving evocation of the flag-raising at Iwo Jima; a mock courtroom in which Helen plays defendant, Hecuba plays prosecutor, and Helen\u2019s vengeful but still lovesick ex-husband Menelaus (Jonathan Fried) plays judge and jury. There are times, especially in the first half of the evening, when patrons barely have time to acknowledge the aptness of one modern-day parallel before another comes along to supplant it.\nThe director also injects more humor than you might expect into the proceedings.

They preach repentance (turning your life around when it is off God\u2019s track) and they anoint and heal. Luke 8:1-3 also shows and names many women who clearly followed Jesus along with \u201cthe twelve\u201d. God calls all of us according to our gifts and talents and presses us into service in many ways for the kin-dom/ reign of God, the reign of justice and peace, to appear on this earth.\nThroughout history God has called women to servant leadership in the Church and to the priesthood,the diaconate and the Episcopate. (See for example Gary Macy, The Hidden History of Women\u2019s Ordination). Historical evidence of this is crystal clear but so often written out of the history books by the male hierarchy in the Church who indeed continue to take it upon themselves to decide whom God can call to the priesthood-only men according to Canon Law"

H., Hernaiz, P., & Vallejo, A. (2019). Impact of rainfall to the effectiveness of pig slurry shallow injection method for NH3 mitigation in a Mediterranean soil. Atm. Environ., 216, 116913.\nAbstract: Ammonia emission from fertilized cropping systems is an important concern for stakeholders, particularly in regions with high livestock densities producing large amounts of manure. Application of pig slurries can result in very large losses of N through NH3 volatilization, thus decreasing the N use efficiency (NUE) of the applied manure. Shallow incorporation has been shown to significantly abate these losses. In this field study, we assessed the impact of contrasting weather conditions on the effectiveness of shallow injection to abate NH3 emissions from pig slurry application to a Mediterranean soil. As potential trade-offs of NH3 abatement, greenhouse gas emissions were also measured under conditions of high soil moisture. Compared with surface application of slurry, shallow injection effectively and significantly decreased NH3 losses independently of weather conditions, but reductions of NH3 emission were greater after heavy rainfall. In contrast, under these conditions, shallow injection triggered higher emissions of N2O and CH4. Our findings reinforce the idea that any single-pollutant abatement strategy needs to be designed and assessed in a regional context and considering potential trade-offs in the form of other pollutants.\nKeywords: ammonia; micrometeorological method; slurry incorporation; trade-offs; nitrous oxide; mediterranean agroecosystems; nitrous-oxide emissions; field-applied manure; organic fertilizers; ammon"

"onna need more lipstick\u201d cartoon, Feb. 12\nDaryl Cagle\u2019s cartoon gave a factually false image of the defense budget as an ugly pig that is much larger than the \u201cdomestic budget.\u201d\nAccording to OMB figures, defense spending will be $439 billion in a total 2007 budget of $2.9 trillion, or 15 percent. Even if one adds the State Department and other international programs, and possible supplemental requests for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the total still comes to less than 20 percent of federal spending. That leaves 80 percent for \u201cdomestic\u201d programs.\nAs a share of the economy, defense spending is at the lowest level since the 1930s. The massive cuts in the 1990s explain why our military is so overextended in what are actually very small wars by historical standards. A country as rich as ours should never be contemplating retreat in the face of insurgent thugs, but we are.\nWhat is driving the increase in federal spending are \u201cmandatory\u201d entitlement programs which are about to consume half the budget.

I am a dedicated Garfield fan and at age 72 it\u2019s not worth my while changing.\nI recently read the following in Publishers Weekly \u201cDan Walsh discovered that if all traces of Jim Davis\u2019s lazy, lasagne-scarfing cat were expunged from his own comic strip, Garfield became a funnier, much darker series, about a desperately lonely, self-loathing man\u2019s existential despair.\u201d\nI was just about to dispatch an electronic snorter to the said Dan Walsh asking, \u201c What do you mean by removing the marmalade cat from the comic strip?\" when I came across a programme on RTE Radio One, produced and presented by Liam Geraghty. In it Dan Walsh explained how Garfield minus Garfield came into existence.\nWalsh tells the story of how he chopped Garfield out of Garfield, gained millions of fans and attracted the attention of the one person he didn\u2019t want to find out about what he\u2019d done: Garfield creator, Jim Davis.\nIn an act that should qualify him for the brilliant editors hall of fame, Dan Walsh discovered that if all traces of Jim Davis\u2019s lazy, lasagne-scarfing cat were expunged from his own comic strip, Garfield became a funnier, much darker series, about a desperately lonely, self-loathing man\u2019s existential despair.\nGarfield Minus Garfield is a site dedicated to removing Garfield from the Garfield comic strips in order to reveal the existential angst of a certain young Mr. Jon Arbuckle. It is a journey deep into the mind of an isolated young everyman as he fights a losing battle against loneliness and depression in a quiet American suburb.\nGar"

Many large companies have the concept of \"ONSHORE\", \"BOARDED\" or \"LOCALIZED\" customers and have done for years. Some help desks I have worked on use these terms so the customers are never routed offshore.\nSome may see this as racism but it is merely to ensure no other country is aware of issues a customer (ie government ) is having.

Now, I don't know the UGA playbook. I don't know what Richt and Bobo name their formations, and I don't know that I'm naming them properly. There is very likely a different name for every RECEIVER alignment out of a specific formation. For instance, in a Twins formation with two receivers set wide to the left, the formation is likely called one thing if the outside receiver is on the line of scrimmage, and another if the inside receiver is on the line of scrimmage. However, I do not know UGA's terminology for it - and I really don't understand how it's going to help anyone out there get a better understanding for me to describe the formations in that degree of minutiae. So, I'm going to keep it simple. Very simply, this is how I will describe formations from here on out (I am abandoning calling every shotgun-single-back formation \"Shotgun Ace\"):\nAn ACE formation is one where the QB is under Center, with the HB behind him.\nAn I-Formation is one where the QB is under Center, with the FB and HB behind him.\nA Power-I"

"teau: chapters from a spy thriller, a coming of age romance, elements which are now familiar to any reader of Fry's first memoir, with Wodehouse and Waugh and what-all besides. It was a delight, front to back. I already knew that Fry is a brilliant entertainer and a crackerjack writer. He is firmly established in my affections by virtue of being a remarkable comedian, actor, director, and one of that uniquely British tribe of in-house BBC intellectuals. He's written an entertaining and very sensible book about poetry. For whatever reason, I've avoided his fiction 'til now, largely I think for fear it would prove inferior to his other efforts. I needn't have denied myself the pleasure.\nWhich is not to say I like the other novel in this \"traveler's\" paperback, because I didn't. The writing was just as good, and if anything the structure and plot of his sophomore effort was superior in every way to his first. But, I didn't finish The Hippopotamus -- nearly, but, no. The central character was a a Kingsley Amis type, the artist as boar; straight, drinky, and more than a bit of a dick. I know this is meant to be forgivable, even ultimately endearing, and very much of a tradition, and it's not as if Fry didn't do the thing justice, he did, but I'm tired of dick in literature. Okay, that's not quite true in every sense, but in this it is. After a hundred pages I had to admit I wished the protagonist dead and the book over, so I gave it up. True, there was quickly much saving camp, and some truly funny satire, but... perhaps I was tired of the fun. Who knows? Anyway, it remained unfinished, and on I went.\nMy other unfinished novel this trip was Statues in a Garden, by Isabel Colegate, but only because I lost the book somewhere. Presumably I left it in some waiting room, or it fell out of my pocket somewhere or something. A pity, because 60 pages in , I was enjoying it. Colegate is the author of The Shooting Party, among other excellent things. (That one was made"
", 2022\nRobust, however. Jackpot-ready.\nThis entry was posted in Guest Post, Permaculture, Politics, Species loss, Technology and innovation on December 4, 2022 by Lambert Strether.\nAbout Lambert Strether\nReaders, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (\u201cBecause markets\u201d). I don\u2019t much care about the \u201cism\u201d that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don\u2019t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess \u201cdeaths from despair,\u201d as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton\u2019s wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of"

Her form mates were the same, but everything else was absolutely changed; she might have been at a new school. She appreciated the convenient arrangements of the handsome building: the lecture-hall, with its stained-glass window and polished floor, the airy classrooms, the studio with its facilities for every kind of art work, the three music-rooms, the laboratory, the gymnasium, and, last but not least, the hostel. Ingred had never before been a boarder, and she had not expected to like the experience, but there is a subtle charm in community life that infects everybody with \u201cthe spirit of the hive,\u201d and in spite of herself she began to be interested in the particular set of faces that met round the table for meals. The greater part of the girls were in the middle and lower school, but there were a few members of the Sixth, who sat next to Mrs. Best, the matron, and Nurse Warner, and looked with superior eyes on the crowd of intermediates and juniors. To have secured such congenial roommates was an asset for which she could not be sufficiently thankful. Whatever troubles might await her downstairs, it was a comfort to know that she had three allies ready to flock to her support. She had not known any of them well in the"

"so it should work for Beal, as well.\nCrawford ends up inside the three-point line in these clips, but the play can be adjusted so Beal catches the ball beyond the three-point line.\nA different pick-and-roll decoy involves having the roll man set another screen instead of looking for the ball. In the video below, we see the pick-and-roll again, but this time the defense attacks the ball handler as he dribbles over the screen. That leaves James Singleton open on the roll. But instead of looking for the ball, he goes to set another screen for Roger Mason. Mason's defender gets no help and the result is a wide open three. We can pretend that Beal is Mason as he drains this three.\nAll of those aforementioned post touches for Nene and Seraphin could benefit Beal beyond just spot-up opportunities. Even if you have a quality post scorer, offenses can\u2019t simply stand around and watch him operate for the whole game. Most defenses will eventually figure out how to send a double team and where to recover. In order to counter that, the Wizards can set off-ball screens while Nene or Seraphin have the ball. The video below shows Crawford using off-ball screens while the defense watches the post player.\nWhen the Wizards go to the horns set, Beal may find himself as the recipient of a double screen to get to the top of the key. This action was successful in freeing up Cartier Martin for open jumpers, and giving Beal some relatively easy shots from his sweet spot could help the rookie gain confidence.\nAlthough Beal didn't have much experience shooting corner threes at Florida, they are one of the most efficient shots an NBA player can take. He hit his threes from the right corner, and it just so happens that the Wizards had a nifty play to get Nick Young an open three from the right corner. There's a lot of movement and screening, both on- and off-ball, until Young gets a screen and darts to the corner for an open shot. Check it out below.\nIn the 2011-12 season, the Wizards were one of the worst teams in the NBA in points per off-ball screening possession,"

"t do lanes. But it\u2019s not a brand-new startup, either. Founded in 1999, its first title was an ESL book for Grades 1 to 12.\nKara highlighted the editorial process for DC Canada\u2019s small team by noting that before reviewing submissions, searching for illustrators, and finally getting to designing and printing, the team ensures that their materials meet two criteria: 1) it\u2019s a good book for children; and 2) it has educational value. Kara highlighted that a wide variety of materials can be considered \u201ceducational\u201d, with recent release, Recess in the Dark, focusing on cultural education.\nEvery new title goes through a similar submission process: three to five staff will read a manuscript and recommend accepting or rejecting it. As with all book publishers, marketability is a consideration, as well as whether it\u2019s the right book for the company at the right time.\nDC looks for a balance of good storytelling and educational value, which may not always be apparent in the theme or subject of the book.\nRecess in the Dark, for example, is about children going to school in the North; its title refers to winter school days of little or no sunlight. It does explain that dog teams are still used in the North because they\u2019re more dependable than snowmobiles. But much of the text is poetry, and Recess in the Dark walks readers through the fundamentals of verse.\nA notable asset of DC Canada is that it showcases educational materials in English, French and Chinese. The company began as a resource for teaching ESL learners and has since grown to include books, games, read-alongs, and a wide range of multimedia resources for children.\nKara also shared a few favourites she would recommend, including Our Farm in the City, which details the experimental farm in Ottawa to talk about science and nature, and One Story a Day, that illustrates a different topic for each day to stir a new conversation each day with your child (365 stories total!)\nKara\u2019s advice to children\u2019s book authors was inspiring: \u201cWhen you\u2019re coming up with a concept for that children\u2019s book, think about what\u2019s unique about your book.\u201d She went on further to say, \u201cYou have this responsibility to share important messages\u201d about ideas"

"join us in sending a strong, united message to the EPA.\u201d\nA current regulation prohibits E15 sales between June 1 and Sept. 15, except for use in flex-fuel vehicles. Farmers would benefit from increased sales of higher blends of ethanol while consumers would benefit from lower fuel prices and lower emissions. Retailers have shown they want to offer this fuel if the outdated government regulation is removed.\nSouth Dakota\u2019s 16 ethanol plants produce more than 1 billion gallons of ethanol annually. Through a Prime the Pump program organized by ethanol industry leaders, including South Dakota Corn, the number of stations selling E15 has grown nationally to 1,700 in 30 states. The program has secured commitments that will increase the number of retail locations to 2,800 by 2021, generating an expected 350 million new gallons of ethanol annually. Year-round sales would boost that amount considerably. The ban on summer sales has been a major roadblock in preventing even more gas stations from offering E15.\nEthanol has been a top priority for South Dakota Corn since it funded feasibility studies, set up infrastructure for the state\u2019s first ethanol plants and worked to ensure the state\u2019s corn farmers could invest in those plants.\nAll ethanol industry organizations have worked doubly hard on the E15 issue since President Trump initially announced his support for a rule change. Trump officially directed the EPA to begin its rule-changing process last October.\nBrian Jennings, CEO of the American Coalition for Ethanol, said that group was pleased but cautioned that time is of the essence.\n\u201cWe will urge stakeholders to provide public comment to EPA, so a legally-defensible rule can be in place by June 1,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cWithout a final rule in place by June 1, this year would mark the eighth time, since EPA originally approved a waiver for E15, that fuel marketers in many parts of the country have had to prohibit their customers from purchasing a lower-cost, higher-quality fuel option at the pump during the busy summer driving months.\u201d\nJennings"

The damper rod along with its shim stack valve pass through the cylinder like piston as the suspension compresses and rebounds. The mercury within is displaced and passes through channels into the channels machined into the wall of the body.\nThe Inerter (yellow) is mounted between the rockers\nLRGP provide a diagram for the Inerters mounting. This being a typical position between the pushrod rockers. No doubt a similar mounting is found between the rear pull rod rockers. Externally it would be hard distinguish the Fluid Inerter from a Mechanical version. Albeit the Renault front bulkhead design shows almost nothing of the Inerter inside the footwell. The steering rack and anti roll bar getting in the way of the small aperture inside the front of the monocoque. Thus we cannot be clear if the device has raced.\nOne benefit is the technology is proprietary to LRGP and not used under license via Penske or Dr Malcolm Smith. Thus LRGP are free to use and develop this technology freely.\nI couldn\u2019t state whether the Fluid Inerter has any compliance benefits over a mechanical one. Perhaps it\u2019s easier to tune via the shim stack in the damper rod, rather than the fixed specification of the mechanical Inerter. Equally it may be easier to maintain, teams needing to strip clean and re-grease their Mechanical Inerters frequently to maintain their smooth operation.\nIt seems one advantage to this device might be lightweight. The tiny amount of fluid required would be lighter than an equivalent spinning mass. As Inerters tend to be mounted relatively high a weight saving will aid CofG height, as well as ballast placement.\nOne negative issue is that Mercury is a hazardous material.

Most of her work relates to the first \u201c1000 Days\u201d --- the time period from conception through the first 2 years of a child\u2019s life. She explores factors related to healthy pregnancy and birth outcomes and early child growth. In the context of the developmental origins of adult health and disease (DOHaD), she investigates how early life factors relate to health and well-being in adulthood. Adair has led the Cebu (Philippines) Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey since 1990. This birth cohort study is also part of an international collaboration (COHORTS) that has yielded a number of important insights about the early origins of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases in low and middle income countries. Adair also studies infant feeding and growth in the context of HIV. Work in Malawi and Rwanda is focused on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and how breastfeeding and complementary feeding influence infant growth and survival. Her work in South Africa explores how maternal health affects infant pre- and early postnatal growth. A strong methods focus is on longitudinal and structural modeling of growth-related outcomes.

"How Can I Control My Google Ads Advertising Costs?\nThere are several ways that businesses can manage and control how much they spend on AdWords advertising.\nYou can lower your cost per click across your campaigns by raising your Quality Scores. Quality Score is largely a result of achieving a higher than expected click-through rate, so increase your click-through rates by writing highly relevant ads that hit searchers on an emotional level so they can\u2019t help but click.\nFor tips on writing super-high-CTR ads, check out our study of what factors go into the best-performing ads in Google Ads.\nThere are a few other techniques you can use to reduce your online ad costs.\nThe first is a technique known as dayparting or ad scheduling. This allows you to specify windows of time throughout the day when your ads can be shown. For example, a brick-and-mortar retail business may want to maximize foot traffic to its physical locations, and using dayparting enables advertisers to restrict ads to hours or days when the store is open.\nAdjusting dayparting settings in Google Ads.\nAside from offering greater control over when ads are displayed, dayparting can be used to reduce costs, even during \u201csuboptimal\u201d windows. If you look at the figure below, you\u2019ll see that the average cost-per-action (CPA) can fluctuate widely depending on the time of day. This offers canny advertisers an opportunity to reduce costs if ad budgets are being stretched thin.\nCPA by time of day, across both weekday and weekend searches. Notice how weekend CPAs tend to be significantly higher than weekday CPAs.\nAnother way to control your Google Ads budget is through geotargeting.\nTo continue our real-world retail business example from above, the same business hoping to attract foot traffic to a physical store probably isn\u2019t going to see much return on ads being shown to users that live outside that business\u2019 service area.\nGeotargeting options in effect in Google Ads. This example shows a physical radius of 20 miles around Boston.\nThis is what makes geotargeting so powerful; it allows advertisers to target the locations that are likely to have the greatest impact.

In 2018, a 60% scale twelve (12) rotor eVTOL Proof Of Concept (POC) was being tested to carry out small scale parachute drops tests.\nThe single seat Lancer ePAV is based around a tried and tested frame construction which includes a unique form of stability/control technology unique in current eVTOL designs. A future dual seat Lancer ePAV is also planned.\nSeveral key design elements can be noted with this aircraft. A wing is used to extend the flight range of the aircraft.

"ies such as Microsoft, Shopify and Swiss Re are buying into direct air capture to offset their emissions.\nBut a massive scale-up in facilities is needed to help the world reach net zero by 2050, says the International Energy Agency.\nThe world\u2019s journey towards net zero emissions is taking us down many new roads when it comes to technology. Electric vehicles and renewable energy are among those helping us to stop emitting carbon, but direct air capture takes another approach \u2013 sucking CO2 we emit back out of the atmosphere.\nDirect air capture could be a solution for combatting carbon emissions that are hard to avoid \u2013 like those from certain industries \u2013 and for removing carbon that has been emitted over past decades.\nHere\u2019s a quick explainer.\nWhat is direct air capture?\nDirect air capture \u2013 DAC for short \u2013 involves capturing carbon dioxide directly from the air. The CO2 can then be permanently stored, meaning that it stops contributing to global warming.\nA direct air capture plant in Iceland is capturing 4,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year and storing it in basalt, a type of volcanic rock. The CO2 then mineralizes over around 20 years, turning into stone in a natural reaction with the rock.\nThe captured CO2 can also be reused in other industries. In food processing, it can be used to carbonate drinks. And in aviation, it is being combined with hydrogen to create synthetic low-carbon fuel.\nThe amount of direct air capture capacity in the world is rising fast, but it needs to rise even faster to help the world reach net zero emissions. Image: IEA\nTwo technologies are used in direct air capture \u2013 liquid and solid DAC. Liquid DAC involves passing air through a chemical solution to remove any carbon dioxide. In solid DAC, the CO2 is captured in a filter system.\nWhere is direct air capture today?\nThere are 19 direct air capture facilities in operation worldwide, the International Energy Agency (IEA) says. Of these, 18 are in Canada, Europe and the United States, according to the IEA report Direct Air Capture: A Key Technology for Net Zero.\nNew plants are also being built.

He\u2019s a world class cricketer with more experience than Father Time himself. He knows the time and place to gamble, and today was not the day to wager his bitstarz bonus code 2019. He knew the pitch was slow and anything close to 250 might prove challenging in a run chase. So he just did his thing. And boy did he do it effectively.\nAfter facing 100 balls Mathews score was just 68. We haven\u2019t seen run rates like that since Peter Moores was in charge of England\u2019s ODI team, and Cook and Trott were opening the batting. But what we would have paid for a Cook, a Trott, or even an Ian Bell in this particular game.\nAll England needed to do was stay in, rotate the strike, and pick up the occasional two or boundary. But oh no. That\u2019s not the way we play.\nWith the exception of Joe Root and Ben Stokes, who both played sensibly, England\u2019s batting was the shambles it often is on turgid surfaces. I felt really sorry for Stokes at the death. He couldn\u2019t have done any more. It was heartbreaking to see him marooned and helpless at the death.\nHowever, it\u2019s a red herring to focus on individual positives when the team batted so poorly as a whole. This line-up still struggles to adapt when conditions don\u2019t suit our millionaire\u2019s approach.\nI\u2019m not sure who to blame for England\u2019s continued batting failures on slow pitches.

", we become acutely sensitive to the interdependence of life. \u2013 Ann Zwinger , Introduction\nThe Sea as Teacher\nThough published in 1951, therefore knowing our understanding of marine ecology has continued to develop, most of us likely won\u2019t have read or studied too deeply about the sea, in fact, many remain (with good reason) in fear of it \u2013 not understanding her mood changes, dangerous rips, turbulent surf and the menacing creatures that live within her depths.\nHere a casual reader with an interest in nature writing of a literary kind will learn and absorb much about the sea, the ocean, her characteristics, behaviours, secrets and influences with little effort, such is her mastery of narrating a serious subject in an engaging and memorable way.\nTalking about the seasons, we discover the sea too experiences events that herald those forthcoming changes.\nThe lifelessness, the hopelessness, the despair of the winter sea are an illusion. Everywhere are the assurances that the cycle has come to the full, containing the means of its own renewal. There is the promise of a new spring in the very iciness of the winter sea, in the chilling of the water, which must, before many weeks, become so heavy that it will plunge downward, precipitating the overturn that is the first act in the drama of spring.\nFrom Sea to Land, and the Moon Question\nTaking us back to the beginning we learn how the sea might have come about, reading of a once believed theory that the moon may have been a child of the earth, born of a great tidal wave of earthly substance, torn off and hurled into space, leaving a scar or depression on the surface of the globe, that now holds the Pacific Ocean.\nWhether or not that is true, we do know the moon affects the tides and cycles of many animals. Where the Moon came from continues to be debated today.\nWe familiarise with the evolution of tides, the moon effect, the significant evaporation of the Mediterranean which makes it excessively salty and more dense and learn of the rush of a current from the Atlantic that replaces it, lighter water that pours past Gibraltar in surface streams of great strength.\nPhoto by Artem Mizy"
"idents due to false positives in the model, and more. There are emerging research communities and angles that seek to mitigate these issues, through focusing for instance on fairness, safety, and interpretability. In his latest book Human Compatible, Prof. Stuart Russell at UC Berkeley recommends the principle that \u201cthe machine is initially uncertain about what the human preferences are,\u201d and will seek to actively learn these preferences. At the World AI Conference in 2020, Prof. Andrew Yao at Tsinghua University endorsed a similar principle and encouraged the exploration of theoretical areas such as probability theory and game theory.\nThe Latest Noteworthy Development: \u201cCasual influence diagrams for AI safety, Learning from human feedback, ML for climate change, and More\u201d\nIn the past several years, promising approaches and techniques have emerged for ensuring that safe and beneficial AI can be developed:\nThe use of causal influence diagrams for understanding agent incentives and modelling AI safety frameworks. Casual influence diagrams is a well-established type of graphical model used to represent decision-making problems. In these diagrams, graphical criteria can be used to determine both agent observation incentives and agent intervention incentives. (Everitt, T., Carey, R., Langlois, E., Ortega, P., Legg, S.

"find out more about the most recent updates on the options of testing, vaccination, and treatment available for the treatment of Langya henipavirus (LayV).\nWhat causes Langya Henipavirus (LayV)?\nLangya henipavirus (LayV) is a zoonotic henipavirus classified in the family Paramyxoviridae. It was detected during sentinel surveillance of febrile patients with a recent history of animal exposure in China. The virus was discovered in a throat swab specimen of a patient through metagenomic analysis and virus isolation. Subsequent investigations have revealed that the Langya henipavirus (LayV) has caused a total of acute infections in a total of 35 patients) in the Henan and Shandong provinces of northeastern China since 2018. Sharing the same genus, the Langya henipavirus (LayV)is closely related to the Nipah virus and the Hendra virus which are known to infect humans and cause potentially fatal disease, along with other henipaviruses found in bats, rodents, and shrews. However, the phylogenetically closest relative of Langya henipavirus (LayV) was found to be the Mojiang henipavirus, which was identified in southern China.\nWhat is the natural host of Langya Henipavirus (LayV)?\nFurther investigations are required to determine the exact natural reservoir of the Langya henipavirus (LayV). However, a serosurvey performed by Zhang et al. (2022) has identified the shrew as a potential natural reservoir of LayV. Indeed, the serosurvey has revealed that among the 25 species of wild small animals surveyed, shrews displayed the highest level of seropositivity with a 27% detection rate. On the other hand, the serosurvey of domestic animals identified lower levels of seropositivity in goats and dogs with 2% and 5% detection rates, respectively. These findings suggest that Langya henipavirus (LayV) can affect various species such as humans, dogs, goat, and its likely natural host, shrews.\nHow"

Here, however, the cable linking the logger to the sensor was secured at two sites on the head (the top of the head and the nape of the neck) using a spot of epoxy resin enclosing the cable and binding it to the feathers (Wilson et al.,2002). In addition, birds were equipped with Lotek LTD 100 loggers(Lotek Marine Technologies, 114 Cabot Street, St John's, NF, A1C1Z8 Canada). These units recorded, among other things, depth (12 bit resolution) at 1 s intervals. The units were 57 mm long and 18 mm diameter, weighed 16 g in air(1.8 g in seawater) and were attached to the birds by neoprene-backed plastic leg rings. Birds were left to go on a single foraging trip before the devices were removed and the data downloaded.\nBeak and depth data were treated simultaneously using the software MT-beak(Jensen Software Systems, Laboe, Germany). This software displayed the data on the screen in the form of two graphs against a time axis. The program identified deviations in beak opening events (with a threshold set by the user) and determined the start and end time of the events and maximum values within the defined periods. These values were stored in a separate file together with data on depth.\nDuring the experiments the penguins opened their beaks for a variety of reasons including preening, biting, vocalizing or swallowing (cf. Wilson et al., 2002). The following results, however, are confined to periods when the birds did none of these things. During breathing in penguins that were fully rested no beak movement was observed or recorded by the IMASEN. This constituted about 60% of the time that the birds were equipped with the unit. However, during periods of increased metabolic rate (see below), the beak opened and closed systematically so that inter-mandibular angle (hereafter referred to as beak angle) described a waveform over time (Fig. 1A). This waveform was essentially bilaterally symmetrical about its peak (Fig. 1B) but was not,however, sinusoidal"

"which are easily available and can be very destructive,\u201d said Randall S. Murch, a former F.B.I. scientist who has studied ways to trace a bioterrorist attack to its source.\nAnd Congressional investigators recently warned that the proliferation of biodefense research laboratories presents real threats, too.\nMore people in more places handling toxic agents create more opportunities for an accident or intentional misuse by an insider, Keith Rhodes, an investigator with the Government Accountability Office, said at a Congressional hearing in October.\nNationwide, an estimated 14,000 people work at about 400 laboratories and have permission to work with so-called select agents, which could be used in a bioterror attack, although not all are authorized to handle the most toxic substances, like anthrax. With so many people involved, there is insufficient federal oversight of biodefense facilities to make sure the laboratories follow security rules and report accidents that might threaten lab workers or lead to a release that might endanger the public, Mr. Rhodes testified.\nIn effect, the government may be providing the tools that a would-be terrorist could use, said Richard H.

"many restaurants and motels opened along the street. The Jack Tar Hotel and Bathhouse includes the last bathhouse built to support this trade. The complex included a motor court, a coffee shop, and a restaurant called the Rainbow Room. The other buildings were constructed in 1946, with the hotel and bathhouse following in 1950. With the adoption of new medical technology and the shift of tourists to areas south of the city, many of the businesses along Park Avenue closed or changed focus. The Jack Tar was renovated in 1980 and served as a nursing home before becoming a senior living facility.\nDesigned by Irven Granger McDaniel, the north-facing hotel is five stories and is located on Oriole Street near the intersection with Park Avenue. When the building was constructed, the first floor held mechanical equipment, while the second and third floors each contained twenty hotel rooms. The rooms each had a kitchenette. The fourth and fifth floors were separate bathing floors for men and women.\nThe exterior of the building is covered in buff brick, and balconies constructed from I-beam steel run the length of the building on the second through fifth floors. The building rests on a hill that increases in height from west to east. The first floor of the building has doors and windows that are approximately nine feet tall on the east end, but due to the slope, the doors and windows on the west end are about sixteen feet tall. An elevated pedestrian bridge is located near the center of the front of the building. It connects the second-floor lobby to a building located on the north side of Oriole Street. The walkway allowed guests to visit the other buildings in the complex, which were later removed. The exterior of the other building is brick and stucco. The covered walkway is constructed from the same brick with rectangular aluminum windows. The rear of the building has been modified with the removal of the top balcony. The first floor is undergrade in the rear of the building due to the slope. Other changes to the building include the addition to two covered external stairways and the enclosure of some openings with buff brick.\nLocal legend suggests that the first floor of the building was mostly bare to allow for the installation of an illegal casino, although conclusive proof does not exist.

This is the first study ever devoted to this class of objects, which we call Low-excitation blobs (LEBs).\nMethods : We used low-dispersion spectroscopy carried out at ESO to obtain emission line intensities of Ha, Hb, and (OIII) (4959+5007) for 15 objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud and 14 objects in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Results are displayed in excitation (oiii/Hb ratio) versus Hb luminosity diagrams.\nResults : We show the presence of an LEB component in the Magellanic Clouds and study its relationship with the already known class of high-excitation blobs (HEBs). The newly found LEBs are lower excitation counterparts of HEBs and are powered by less massive exciting stars. Further study of LEBs is expected to provide new pieces of information for a better understanding the low mass end of the upper initial mass function in the Magellanic Clouds.\nThree-colour image of N49 in H\u03b1 (red), (O III) (green), and (Ne V) (blue).

If Aprilia dealt the class the coup de grace by exploiting its monopoly position, they were arguably only wielding the sword handed to them by Honda's refusal to actively support the class any more and arguing for its replacement by a four-stroke formula. And yet the rider taking the title will do so on either an Aprilia RSA 250 (though rebadged as a Gilera), or a Honda RS250RW.\nThe journey to the title showdown at Valencia has been a long and rather convoluted one. Scot Honda's Hiroshi Aoyama and Mapfre Aspar's Alvaro Bautista made all of the early running, swapping both the championship lead and race wins. But a series of crashes by Bautista and a late surge by Marco Simoncelli saw the Spaniard drop out of the equation, and the Italian on the Gilera take his place.\nSimoncelli will need a lot of luck to prevent Aoyama from taking the title, though. The Scot Honda man leads by 21 points, and needs only an 11th place finish to become the first Japanese World Champion since Dajiro Katoh in 2001. Though Aoyama's record is not good at Valencia - his best result here is a 6th place - the Japanese rider likes the track and has shown sufficient consistency to make 11th a fairly safe bet. What's more, Aoyama arrives at Valencia bolstered by a victory taken in a real fairing-bashing humdinger of a race at Sepang, in which he faced and successfully fought off the challenge from his rival Simoncelli. Aoyama has announced that the best form of defense is attack, and is unlikely just to settle for a place mid-pack.\nSimoncelli's task is simple: He has"

Their playbook is to invoke Trump and his \u201cBig Lie\u201d claims as often as possible, and any Republican who votes against Cheney is a chance to do that. When asked this week about the Cheney saga, President Joe Biden took the opportunity to sow the message of disunity in the Republican Party and called it a \u201cmini-revolution.\u201d\nThe makeup of Congress, and the current filibuster rules in an evenly divided Senate, make it more challenging for Democrats to quickly push through legislation, but Biden\u2019s speech to Congress gave the distinct impression that Democrats are just getting started.\nMarket Data at 10 a.m. EDT: Will Liz Cheney win the 2022 House GOP nomination in WY-AL?\nMarket Pulse: Since Monday, we asked traders if Cheney will keep her conference chair position through the end of the summer, and the overwhelming answer is \u201cno!\u201d Though the market hit a high of 87\u00a2 on opening day, itQ quickly dropped to close Monday at 38\u00a2 and has continued a downward trend \u2013 closing Thursday at 6\u00a2.\nCriticism of Stefanik\u2019s voting record doesn\u2019t seem to have harmed her chances of becoming House GOP conference chair with traders. As soon as the market for who will be the GOP conference chair went up Wednesday, Stefanik shot to the top and hasn\u2019t gone below 85\u00a2. She ended Thursday at 94\u00a2.

"except it's also our world now.\nThe targeted strike approach was largely borrowed from the Israeli playbook. Like Israel, the United States is in a tangled conflict that won't end any time soon. And like Israel, it's relying on saving some lives and weakening the terrorist infrastructure by taking out a few leaders here and there. Israel's targeted strikes on Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders never ended the conflict, but aborted more than a few terrorist plots by killing the bomb-makers and planners who were making them happen.\nThe actual conflict did not end. Neither did the attacks. Rather than shooting soldiers, Israel was shooting officers, because shooting soldiers required extended ground engagements and occupations that had become politically untenable. The United States has embraced the same strategy for the same reasons using technology that came out of Israel. But it hasn't given much thought to what comes after that.\nThe failure of the targeted strikes and arrests of terrorist leaders led Israel to pursue a physical separation through barriers and fences. The terrorists compensated for that with rockets and shelling. That led Israel to develop the Iron Dome, a defensive anti-rocket system. The suicide bomber, once ubiquitous, became a rarity, but the attacks have grown more powerful as the terrorists used the territory that they gained through Israeli withdrawals to deploy heavier long-range weapons that can reach major cities.\nIf the United States follows this same pattern of withdrawal and fortification, then by 2028, there might be an actual Fortress America guarded by anti-missile systems against Pakistani, Iranian and Egyptian nukes. And that scenario, as troubled as it sounds, is probably one of the better ones.\nIsrael withdrew from physical territories opening the way for a Hamas takeover of Gaza. Obama withdrew from geopolitical territories, announcing in Cairo that the United States would no longer support the undemocratic dictators of the Muslim world unless they had oil. Hamas, or its Egyptian parent organization, took over Egypt. Across the region, Islamist regimes rose and American allies fell. The Islamist winners of democratic elections turned into dictators leaving the United States"
"the animal on the flight booked, as the number of animals that can be transported is limited.\nThe animal is located in the machine in an air-conditioned area between the passenger deck and the cargo area. As a rule, no member of the crew takes care of the animal during the flight, not even to give water or food.\nHowever, experience has shown that the stress of checking in and the take-off phase is so stressful for most animals that they sleep for most of the flight. The administration of sedatives before check-in is not only not recommended, as their effects cannot be foreseen under these conditions, but is even prohibited for reasons of security (smuggling). Many airlines also exclude a number of dogs (attack dogs) from transport.\nAnimal transport without an accompanying person\nIn this case, a specialist company must be commissioned with the transport, which then takes care of everything else. However, it should be ensured that the animal is picked up at the arrival airport by someone who is familiar to the dog. And of course all import regulations for pets for the country have to be explored beforehand and strictly adhered to.\nIt has proven to be very helpful if you have accustomed the animal to such a transport container at home a few weeks before the intended flight.\nSerbia: embassies, consulates and tourist office\nNational Tourism Organization of Serbia\n\u010cika-Ljubina 8\nTel: 00381 \u2013 (0) 11 \u2013 6557-100\nFax: 00381 \u2013 (0) 11 \u2013 2626-767\nWeb: www.serbia. travel\nwww.serbia-tourism.org\nTravel medicine and hazards\nThe following infectious diseases can be expected in Serbia:\nMalaria, there is no risk of malaria in the country.\nAIDS, HIV\nAmoebic dysentery\nBacterial agitation\nLyme disease, as a result of tick bites\nCholera, an infection risk only exists for travelers who come into contact with polluted water or contaminated food\nIntestinal infections from contaminated food or water, including amoeba, lamb"

In the 1960s, Mohammed Rafi sang maximum songs for Shashi Kapoor, while he got replaced by Kishore Kumar in the 1970s. Yet Rafi rendered his voice for a few hit songs of Shashi in the 1970s like Janu Meri Jaan for Shaan (1980).\n10. Mujhe Dekhkar Aapka Muskurana from Ek Musafir Ek Haseena (1962) (Lyricist: S. H.

"1 season will go forward with both live and virtual ticket types. They've remained flexible with public health guidelines and have already pushed their first show to the end of the season. They've turned their parking lot into an outdoor lobby for this summer's season.\nDuring 2020, though, their focus was heavy on community engagement. TIP is located in a small town at the west end of the Thousand Islands, Gananoque. The two theatres are located in heritage buildings, and the Playhouse's summer season is a huge economic driver for the town. When they couldn't conduct a season, they turned to community initiatives including a Reverse Halloween (collecting donated candy, building goodie bags, and delivering them to registered households around the area), a winter coat drive, and more. They also organized a holiday themed Makers Studio series, hiring local artisans and crafters to lead socially-distanced holiday craft workshops.\nI think the main take away from TIP's innovation is using their employees' skills to refocus from creating theatre to serving their town and community. They do this every year in a more inadvertent way by being a key player in local tourism and economic growth, but this year, they applied their community service in a more direct way. They weren't making theatre or revenue (apart from a community-led fundraiser for some facility renovations), but their commitment to their community (and to keeping their staff employed and busy) will reinforce their value in their small town's eyes. It is vital for their survival and ability to recover to have reinforced this local support.\nTuckamore Chamber Festival\nSt. John's, Newfoundland and LabradorSt. John's (Newfoundland and Labrador) Project: Ecology of Being\nThe Tuckamore Chamber Festival pivoted from a planned live festival to a fully digital event.

The horizontally scrolling shooter is similar to the Atari 2600 game The Empire Strikes Back (1982), with AT-AT walkers replaced by giant camels.[1] Confusingly, a very different game from Jeff Minter's Gridrunner series was also released in the US under the name Attack of the Mutant Camels.\nThe player controls a small jet plane and has the task of killing giant yellow camels before they reach the home base. Doing so requires several dozens of shots. The camels retaliate by shooting fireballs from their mouth. Each camel required several shots to destroy; if a camel reached the base, the game was over. Once all camels on a level had been killed, the player had to survive a \"hyperspace\" sequence which required avoiding high-speed missiles. Upon successful completion, the next level presented a new wave of camels, with slightly harder gameplay.\nLlamasoft released a sequel, Revenge of the Mutant Camels, in 1984.\nIn 2011, Attack of the Mutant Camels was chosen to be featured in the Smithsonian Institution's \"The Art of Video Games\" exhibit.\nIn 2012 the assembly language source code of the Konix version of the game was released on GitHub.\n\"Attack of the Mutant Camels\" -- UK title\ngaming computers 80s videogames\nArtwork by Pulp (@xxPulp on Twitter)\nMeet Melvin at Greater Birmingham Humane"
"rical capacity, and four different charging modes. We believe that the Ram ProMaster BEV should come with a 79 kWh package, if not bigger once it hits the market.\nWith a 79-kWh battery, the E-Ducato can cover a distance of up to 280 kilometers (174 miles) in a Worldwide harmonized Light-Duty Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) cycle, the equivalent of 370 kilometers (230 miles) in an urban cycle.\nIt takes no more than half an hour to charge enough to drive 100 kilometers (62 miles). It\u2019s worth mentioning that Stellantis offers a 10-year or 220,000 kilometers (136,700 miles) warranty on the 79-kWh battery pack.\nIn terms of flexibility, to meet such a wide and varied need, E-Ducato also offers a Drive Mode Selector. In the \u201cNormal\u201d position, it ensures an ideal balance between performance and cost, or it can be set to \u201cEco\u201d mode to save energy.\nWhen very heavy loads have to be carried or the vehicle faces a tough incline, the \u201cPower\u201d mode is the right choice. The E-Ducato has two other features to give drivers peace of mind \u2013\n\u201cTurtle Mode\u201d \u2013 similar to the battery saver function on a cell phone. It activates automatically when the battery is low and limits vehicle performance, to make the battery last 8 to 10% longer. \u201cRecovery Mode\u201d \u2013 If one battery module fails, another will replace it to ensure it can continue to run.\nAnd thanks to its original and uncompromising front-wheel-drive architecture, the Ram ProMaster BEV (like the Fiat E-Ducato) has been modeled according to customer requirements.\nWith no bulk under the chassis and sufficient clearance between the side rails, the battery is optimally placed under the floor, leaving its full load capacity, and weighing almost 2 tons.\nAnother obvious advantage is optimal weight distribution and a reduced center of gravity, to improve vehicle handling under all load conditions. That battery can be seen in a recent spy photo from our friends at GabetzSPYUnit."
"s nature-based solutions to climate change include protecting and restoring a mosaic of habitats \u2013 wetlands, woodland and wildflower meadows. All these habitats play a role in sequestering carbon and they are all are critical to restoring biodiversity.

If you would like to get involved please email.\nThe Willow Group\u2019s coppices are growing magnificently in Peace Oak and Leafield and they have secured a grant for more trees (report to follow).\nThe Siemens Factory has taken the lead among Eynsham businesses in asking Eynsham\u2019s NRN to help it increase the biodiversity on its site. Catriona Bass of Long Mead Local Wildlife Site met Jeff Lynes and Rob Balfour for a walk around the site and has written a proposal of ways in which the site could be enhanced to benefit both wildlife and Siemens staff. Watch this space as other businesses follow their example.\nIt is extraordinary how much has been achieved for biodiversity gain in so short a time.

The BSR Sports Department has made their picks for the big game.\nDirector Dylan Bowers: 49ers 31, Chiefs 26\nThe 49ers defense and run game have been the key to their success this year. Slowing down the Chiefs and Patrick Mahomes is tougher said than done, but I believe the Niners defense will get after Mahomes and really make it tough on him with their pass rush. Tevin Coleman and Raheem Mostert will pace the Niners offense and make Mahomes and the Chiefs play from behind. Nick Bosa will force a turnover late in the game and crush Andy Reid\u2019s hopes at getting his first Lombardi Trophy.\nCoordinator Sean Fitzgerald: 49ers 38, Chiefs 35\nI\u2019ve been vacillating on this pick for days, but I\u2019ve finally settled in on the victor.\nI think Mahomes and Kansas City will definitely put up big numbers against San Francisco. However, it\u2019s going to come down to the 49ers making on extra stop. This team is a complete monster.

"of the slow and limited production of local clay from the kara-usu machines. This means that if a grandson is ready to take over a wheel, his grandfather has to retire to make way. This careful approach by the villagers to managing their land and strictly limiting the scale of output means that there will be plenty of clay left for future generations.\nThe Hanatsuki River powers the numerous kara-usu in Onta.\nAt one house, I witnessed a woman busy transferring wet elutriated clay from a trough to a clay-drying kiln. This confirmed what I had read elsewhere that the backbreaking daily work of clay preparation is the responsibility of the Onta women. So to the female readers of this blog, think twice about marrying that handsome potter from Onta because you will find yourself with a very physically demanding job for the rest of your lives. It is truly a revelation to see how much time, work, and space is needed to prepare the clay after seeing the kara-usu, the water pools that dissolve the clay, the clay troughs, and the clay drying kilns.\nA woman loads the clay onto a wheel barrel.\nClay is transferred to the top of the clay drying kiln.\nThe wheel throwing method used in Onta and Koishiwara is strikingly different from the approach that I and many other potters are most familiar with. Instead of starting by centering enough clay to form the entire form, a ball of clay is patted and centered to build the bottom. Coiled clay is subsequently added on top to build the rest of the pot.\nThis method is called neritsuke and is a hybrid form of wheel throwing and coil building. This technique is said to be only possible because of the mastery of the potter to control the speed of the kick wheel. To watch how this is done, here is a link to a YouTube video of a young Onta potter, Sakamoto So, who is throwing plates and applying uchi-hakeme, which is a brush patted slip marking.\nOntayaki mortar from the father and son kiln of Sakamoto Takumi and So with an example of finger marking or yubikaki.\nO"

Yet these are the very things that keep humanity from going hungry, and if you lose them due to government policy sabotage, literally billions of people will starve to death.\nIt is impossible to deny that the very governments running these sabotage operations are somehow not aware of the ramifications of their takedowns of food, energy and fertilizer. They know exactly what they are doing, and they are fully aware of what this will cause: Social upheaval, riots and desperation.\nThe real question, then, is not why these governments are deliberately destroying the food and energy supplies of western nations; the larger question is why do they want civil unrest, riots and desperation?\nA recipe for social disaster\nBecause that\u2019s the recipe they\u2019re running right now. If you want to bake a cake, you whip together eggs, wheat and sugar. If you want to cause civil unrest and riots, you take down the power and food infrastructure by shuttering farms, pipelines and fossil fuels. They are following a recipe to \u201cbake in\u201d exactly the outcome they desire.\nSabotage against infrastructure, carried out by governments, is the weaponization of food scarcity \u2014 a tactic that has been pursued many times throughout history, most notably in the Holodomor of Ukraine, where Soviet leaders deliberately starved millions of Ukrainians to death in the 1930s, primarily to suppress an ethnic group whose politics opposed those of the Soviet empire at the time. As described at Holodomor.ca:\nThis assault occurred in the context of a campaign of intimidation and arrests of Ukrainian intellectuals, writers, artists, religious leaders, and political cadres, who were seen as a threat to Soviet ideological and state-building aspirations.\nSound familiar?

This is the case for the races that produce the German people, primarily the Nordic and the Pf\u00e4lsisch, but also the Eastern, the Dinarish, the Western and the Eastern Baltic races.\nThe Nordic race has a particular position, since it makes up about 50% of the German people, a fact that we can only welcome given what we know of its growth and cultural achievements.\n5. As a German, take a spouse only of the same or of Nordic blood.\nYou and Your People\nThe accomplishments of the Nordic race are the highest of any race in Europe. This is shown in many splendid cultural monuments, not only on European soil, but also deep in Asia and Africa. The investigations are at an early stage, but we already know that there is hardly a nation in North Africa, the Near East, Iran, India and as far as Turkestan that does not show wonderful evidence of Nordic cultures. It must fill us with pride that in our own homeland, in Germany, culture has bloomed in unbroken lines for more than 5000 years, created by people of our"
"two leptons (originating from the Z-boson decay), one photon and missing transverse energy. Several Standard Model processes can give rise to a similar signature; these were modelled as precisely as possible using simulations and data-driven estimates.\nIn addition, researchers used a machine learning technique (Boosted Decision Tree, BDT) to discriminate between events that are more likely from a dark photon (classified with a high BDT score) from those originating from Standard Model processes (classified with lower BDT score). If a dark photon were produced, it would be observed as an excess of events with high BDT score, with respect to the ones expected from Standard Model processes. Physicists looked for dark photons with a wide range of possible masses, ranging from massless to 40 GeV. No excess was observed. This allowed researchers to set exclusion limits on the rate at which the Higgs boson decays into a photon and a dark photon: the results show that the maximum allowed rate ranges from 2.3% for a massless dark photon to up to 2.5% for the other considered masses.\nThe ATLAS Collaboration has set the best exclusion limits at the LHC on the search for Higgs bosons decaying to a photon and dark photon.\nSimilar results were obtained by a previously published analysis, looking for the same Higgs-boson decay, but in a different Higgs production mode (Vector Boson Fusion, characterised by a higher cross-section). This second analysis excluded decays of the Higgs boson to massless dark photons at rates higher than 1.8%. The data were also used to set strong constraints on scenarios with additional Higgs-like bosons that decay in the same way.\nFigure 2: Exclusion limits on the rate of the Higgs-boson decay into a photon and a dark photon (in %), as a function of the dark photon mass. The continuous line shows the observed limit (based on data), while the expected limit (in a simulated Standard-Model-only scenario) is shown with a dashed line, with 1 sigma and 2 sigma uncertainties in green and yellow bands.

"18 December, there's Copa del Rey\"\nclasico football\nMLSMLS Season Pass launches today: all you need to know\nSOCCERKeylor Navas-Forest operation made possible by PSG team mate<s> Sculpting Beyond Sculpture\n[ARCHIVED VERSION. ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED HERE: SCULPTURE NETWORK.]\nWhen I received the Sculpture Network\u2019s invitation to talk about my work I immediately asked myself which of my works would qualify as sculptures. It is not a question that I normally ask myself while making art. My works are the result of experimenting with methods, ideas, materials, and techniques that rarely belong to the history of one specific art form. However, when I look at my work through the lenses of sculpture I notice a recurrent set of artistic strategies for making tangible the invisible operations of nonhuman agents and invisible technological systems.\nThis is, for example, the case of Amazon\u2019s Cabinet of Curiosities (2019), the result of my cooperation with Alexa Voice Shopping, the artificial intelligence developed by Amazon. To produce this work I asked Alexa one question: \u2018Alexa, can you suggest a product for a new artwork?\u2019. Immediately after I bought the recommended product Alexa suggested another one, and then another one, and so on, and on\u2026 I simply followed and acquired every product suggested in this way until my production budget was entirely spent, and the work corresponds to the accumulation of products acquired through Alexa\u2019s suggestions.\nMost of the sculptural qualities of this work come from the actual products featured in the installation, but also from the way these are juxtaposed and presented, using shipping boxes as stands. We can also understand this installation as an ever-growing sculpture. Every time the work is presented it absorbs its production budget and new products are bought and added to the installation. The resulting artwork gets increasingly larger and ends up invading the exhibition space, similarly to how cancer slowly takes over a body or to how capitalism is taking over every facet of our reality.\nEmilio Vavarella, Amazon\u2019s Cabinet of Curiosities, 2019-ongoing, installation with Amazon Alexa and various commercial products"
"through a variety of engaging tours and activities. I took a short walking tour which included the above Penitentiary.\nThe Penitentiary was originally constructed as a flour mill and granary in 1843, before it housed hundreds of convicts in dormitories and solitary cells; or the much-feared Separate Prison, where harsh physical punishment was replaced with punishment of the mind. It housed prisoners until the settlement closed in 1877 and then subsequently was devastated by fire in 1897 leaving only the masonry walls and barred windows.\nThe Port Arthur penal settlement began life as a small timber station in 1830 and quickly grew in importance within the colonies. Ship building was introduced on a large scale as a way of providing selected convicts with a useful skill they could take with them once freed. The 1853 cessation of transportation resulted in fewer transportees arriving at the station, however, Port Arthur\u2019s story did not end with the removal of the last convict.\nAlmost immediately the site was renamed Carnarvon in an attempt to erase the hated \u2018convict stain\u2019. During the 1880s, land was parceled up and put to auction with people taking up residence in and around the old site. The many homes, gardens and buildings are now beautifully preserved and maintained.\nThe ruins of the Broad Arrow cafe at the Port Arthur site where the horrific massacre occurred that took the lives of 35 people and wounded 19 others in and around the grounds on the 28 April 1996 have been turned into a sobering memorial garden and pool.\nPort Arthur was built on a philosophy of discipline and punishment, religious and moral instruction, classification and separation, training and education. Built in 1837, The Church was the cornerstone of religious convict reform. Up to 1100 people attended compulsory services here each Sunday. It was never consecrated allowing for multi-denominational services to be held.\nHOBART: After quite an intense, at times difficult (learning about its brutal history) and also lovely day chatting with one of the veg gardeners while walking around the Port Arthur site,"

The river was given its name over 100 years ago, due to the scent of flowers that dropped in the water from upriver orchards. As the strong floral scent was carried through the river during autumnal months, it resulted in locals naming it as Perfume River. Today, it may not smell as fragrant due to modernisation and the increasing number of riverboats but it\u2019s still one of the most popular landmarks in Hue.

It\u2019s why, for example, he wants to make study abroad opportunities more affordable. After missing out on the experience as an undergrad at LSU, he took advantage of study abroad opportunities all three years of law school. Seeing the world had such a profound impact on him that he allocated funds to allow first-generation and underrepresented students at UIC do the same.\n\u201cMany students from lower socio-economic backgrounds and people of color don't take advantage of these opportunities because they can't,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we have to look intentionally at the opportunities that we have, the resources that we have, and then start making the connection.\u201d\nThat means providing quality academic instruction. That means developing outstanding facilities. And all of that must focus on the students.\n\u201cIf we don't have students at the center of what we do, the university will never be as great as it could be,\u201d he says. \u201cWhether I'm having conversations with the president or provost or the CFO, I'm going to be talking about leading with the students-first agenda.

"Significantly, the various Colors cannot mix; a tunic or spear or paving-stone must be either blue, or purple, or red, but not partly one and partly another Color. Shades of Color Blue clearly appear to be \u201ctruly\u201d blue, and so forth; only the mundane colors can mingle enough to cause confusion. Those who have not seen true Color find this difficult to grasp. This state of affairs in manufacture seems to have its reflection in politics, as the various Cups are always in competition. Thus the influence of the House Cups and their mastery of \u201ctrue Color\u201d greatly affect social, economic and political life in Cryssigens.\nWhat is a Chronicler?

Each screening was followed by a panel discussion which featured creators, actors, and distributors of Israeli shows discussing the effects of these programs going international.\nIn \u201cMossad 101\u201d (\u201cHamidrasha\u201d Hebrew for \u201cThe Academy\u201d) cadets from every level of Israeli society undergo intense training to join their country\u2019s elite, classified intelligence service, the Mossad.\nFauda, which means \u201cchaos\u201d in Arabic, follows a close-knit unit of Mista\u2019arvim, the commando unit of the Israel army whose soldiers are trained in the language, dress and mannerisms of Palestinians, and whose undercover work is hailed in Israel for scuppering terror attacks and guiding military operations. The show won six Ophir Awards, including Best Drama Series, at the Israeli Academy Awards.\nCNN: Netflix says it has found the next \"Homeland\"\nTwo-years ago, Israel Film Festival organizer Meir Fenigstein introduced \"Fauda\" to American audiences- which led to C.A.A.'s TV agent, Adam Berkowitz, selling the subtitled action/suspense series' rights to Netflix. This year, the Fest debuted the 2nd season opener to Israeli series \"Mossad 101,\" which of C.A.A. TV intends to sell the format rights to internationally.\nVideo play"
"1-P3 were investigated. These results are also correlated by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. The computations corroborate the presence of moderate conjugation in the \u03c0-systems, somewhat more accentuated for P3 where more favorable dihedral angles between the porphyrin and thiophene rings are noted. Moreover, the computed excited states are predicted to be \u03c0-\u03c0* in nature with some charge transfer components from the trans-[-C\u2261CPt(L)2C\u2261 C-]nunit to the porphyrin rings. The optical bandgaps range from 1.93 to 2.02 eV for P1-P3. Intense \u03c0-\u03c0*-localized fluorescence emissions typical of the Q-bands of the polymers were observed. The effect of thiophene ring along the polymer chain on the extent of \u03c0-conjugation, luminescent and photovoltaic properties of these metalated materials was also examined. Bulk heterojunction solar cells using these metallopolymers as an electron donor blended with a methanofullerene electron acceptor were studied. In one case, the metallopolymer P3 showed a power conversion efficiency of 1.04% with the open-circuit voltage of 0.77 V, short-circuit current density of 3.42 mA cm-2and fill factor of 0.39 under illumination of an AM 1.5 solar cell simulator.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/ma2006206\nScopus Link\nDive into the research topics of 'Synthesis and photovoltaic properties of new metalloporphyrin-containing polyplatinyne polymers'.
