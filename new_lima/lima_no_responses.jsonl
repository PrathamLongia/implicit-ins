Box Sign has added API support for SMS-based two-factor authentication and for password-protection of documents sent for signature deliveries. Together, these APIs give an added layer of security to customers by helping to verify the identity of signers in third-party and custom applications, and enable customers to address use cases requiring additional authentication.\nNew and deepened integrations\nThis robust set of APIs, combined with SDK support and the rest of the Box platform, delivers a seamless experience for partners to integrate e-signature functionality directly into their systems instead of building a similar solution from scratch.\nFrom workflow automation to notarial services, partners such as UiPath and SIGNiX are already leveraging Sign API\u2019s to help joint customers save development time and enhance business productivity.

Such defects arise due to imperfect packing during the original crystallisation or they may arise from thermal vibrations of atoms at elevated temperatures.\nExplain Schottky defect.\nThe schottky defect arises due to the missing of an equal number of cations and anions from the crystal lattice. This effect does not change the stoichiometry of the crystal. Ionic solids in which the cation and anion are of almost similar size show Schottky defect.\nExample: NaCl.\nPresence of large number of schottky defects in a crystal, lowers its density. For example, the theoretical density of vanadium monoxide (VO) calculated using the edge length of the unit cell is 6.5 g cm-3 but the actual experimental density is 5.6 gcm3. It indicates that there is approximately 14% Schottky defect in VO crystal. Presence of Schottky defect in the crystal provides a simple way by which atoms or ions can move within the crystal lattice.\nWrite short note on metal excess and metal deficiency defect with an example. Metal excess defect.\nMetal excess defect arises due to the presence of more number of metal ions as compared to anions.Alkali metal halides NaCl, KCl show this type of defect.The electrical neutrality of the crystal can be maintained by the presence of anionic vacancies equal to the excess metal ions (or) by the presence of extra cation and electron present in interstitial position.\nFor example, when NaCl crystals are heated in the presence of sodium vapour, Na+ ions are formed and are deposited on the surface of the crystal. Chloride ions (Cl\u2013) diffuse to the surface from the lattice point and combines with Na+ ion.\nThe electron lost by the sodium vapour diffuse into the crystal lattice and occupies the vacancy created"}]}

The dynamic technique allows arbitrary intensity profiles to be generated using a single unidirectional sweep of the collimators. The collimator jaws have independent motion, so that an aperture of variable width is scanned across the field. The algorithm has the form of a constrained optimization problem and jaw motions are optimized such that the treatment time for the field at a given dose rate is minimized. The application and results of this technique are presented, and it is shown that this approach provides an efficient practical implementation of conformal radiotherapy plans based on the use of intensity-modulated fields. The technique can be extended to 3D treatment plans and fields through the use of computer-controlled multileaf collimators.\nIntensity modulated radiation therapy treatment plan optimization\nIn this paper, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of optimization models for static radiation therapy treatment planning, focusing in particular on intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) by (i) establishing a novel connection between risk management and radiation therapy treatment planning, and (ii) unifying and contrasting two different modeling approaches.

Non-contaminated concrete waste is assumed to be disposed in a landfill site, but that will not be the solution especially in the future, because of decreasing tendency of the site availability and natural resources. Concerning concrete recycling, demand for roadbeds and backfill tends to be less than the amount of dismantled concrete generated in a single rural site, and conventional recycled aggregate is limited of its use to non-structural concrete, because of its inferior quality to ordinary natural aggregate. Therefore, it is vital to develop high quality recycled aggregate for general uses of dismantled concrete. If recycled aggregate is available for high structural concrete, the dismantling concrete is recyclable as aggregate for industry including nuclear field. Authors developed techniques on high quality aggregate reclamation for large amount of concrete generated during NPP decommissioning. Concrete of NPP buildings has good features for recycling aggregate; large quantity of high quality aggregate from same origin, record keeping of the aggregate origin, and little impurities in dismantled concrete such as wood and plastics. The target of recycled aggregate in this development is to meet the quality criteria for NPP concrete as prescribed in JASS 5N 'Specification for Nuclear Power Facility Reinforced Concrete' and JASS 5 'Specification for Reinforced Concrete Work'. The target of recycled aggregate concrete is to be comparable performance with ordinary aggregate concrete. The high quality recycled aggregate production techniques are assumed to apply for recycling for large amount of non-contaminated concrete.

Kyle Davidson believes that Korchinski would be more valuable than Alex Debrincat in the long term... And this, as it has been speculated already, will Davidson's first major gamble of his career and the one that will forever determine his success as general manager.\nSure, there is a lot to like about Korchinski. He skates amazingly, is an offensive dynamo on defense, takes hits like a champ, has height, and projects to be a top-two defenseman. However, that is not what he will be expected to be for the Blackhawks fan base... Most likely. When you trade a superstar in what is honestly a one-for-one deal for a prospect, the prospect will be expected to offer as much if not more for the team. Korchinski will be expected to be a number 1 defenseman for the Blackhawks who can dominate on both ends of the ice.\nKyle Davidson has decided to build a team that follows his vision: Fast, high work ethic, and responsible on both ends of the ice. He has allowed Dylan Strome and Dominik Kubalik to walk because they don't fit the new identity. With that said... Alex Debrincat did fit the mold here but we know that he was, after Patrick Kane, the Blackhawks' most valuable piece. Everyone expected more in a return for Debrincat... But all the Blackhawks really got was Kevin Korchinski.\nI will be rooting for the kid like every Blackhawks fan, but I will also have high expectations and expect Korchinski to develop into a Cale Makar type defenseman with comparable impact. If he doesn't become a top-defenseman in the league like Alex Debrincat is a top-scorer in the league"}]}

Various state anti-discrimination laws have ruined Christian wedding businesses with large fines and legal fees, and also led to many others receiving abuse from LGBT activists.\nThe issue is now before the US Supreme Court in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, a saga which began in 2012 when Masterpiece Cakeshop refused to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex wedding. They were then sued under Colorado state law which bars discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in public accommodations. The Court is considering if the law violates the free exercise of religion under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\nBut businesses being forced to serve people whose beliefs/lifestyles they disagree with would appear to only go one way. Since the election of Trump, his supporters have found themselves the target of abuse and discrimination.

In the first condition, the simulated data have identical between-person and within-person variance. As a result, we obtain a low ICC and conclude that the measurement instrument fails to adequately discriminate among persons. However, critically, we also obtain a rather low CV, implying high precision to detect deviation from zero (see left panel of Figure 2). In the second instance, between-person standard deviation was larger than within-person standard deviation by a factor of five. This condition yields a high ICC reflecting the fact that the measure discriminates well among persons. At the same time, CV remains low, which implies reasonable precision of detecting differences from zero. This is because the within-person variance is still relatively low in comparison to the means (see right panel of Figure 2).\nEach plot shows simulated data of 10 repeated measurements of a fictitious outcome X for five persons.\nWithin-person variance is identical over persons and panels. Left panel: Between-person variance is identical to within-person variance. In that case, ICC-indexed reliability is estimated at a rather low ICC = 0.48, whereas CV-indexed precision is fair, with averaged CV = 0.07. Right panel: Between-person standard deviation is larger than within-person standard deviation by a factor of five. In this condition, estimated ICC-indexed reliability is high (ICC = 0.96), but CV-indexed precision remains identical with averaged CV = 0.07 as the within-person standard deviation is still fairly small with respect to the sample mean.\nIn summary, whereas the CV refers to the precision of measurement obtained from each object, the ICC expresses a part-whole relation of variance observed in the data. All other things being equal, a less precise measurement will increase the variance-within, and hence compromise our ability to detect between-person differences.

When it's in the really bad flared up stage, that's where I'm going to tell them \"Don't do that.\" But as they begin to get a little bit more movement, I'm going to do exactly what you said, just tell them to push the envelope a little bit, but we don't want to do it when it's really in that flared up stage because that will, a lot of times, increase the neural sensitivity.\nWell, basic inflammation approaches, meaning if it's inflamed, we treat it carefully. And this isn't the place, and, like you said, to stimulate or increase, willy-nilly at least, the inflammation. We want to calm it. We want to increase the adaptive range around it.

That's a nice, objective measure of improvement that really stimulates positive thought and positive momentum about making progress in there.\nWell, it gives another marker besides just, \"It hurts,\" too.

We follow the life of Sparrowhawk, whose true name in the Old Language is Ged, and in the magic world of Earthsea true names have power. By knowing the true name of a creature or a thing you can enchant it, or control it.\nAs we follow Ged from childhood through troublesome adolescence, to his apprenticeship with the Wizard Ogion and his tutelage at the School of Wizards on Roke, he finds himself on a quest to defeat the shadow that has plagued him since an I\u2019ll-advised magical pissing contest with a fellow student unleashed it into the world. And the shadow knows Ged\u2019s name.\nThis book is wonderful. A short read at just 161 pages in length, it has deceptively simple linear narrative, and magnificent world building that sucks you in to Earthsea, with its archipelago of islands, complex and highly functioning trade routes, and deep respect for magic and the role of wizards. Whilst we see many villages as we travel with Ged, the inhabitants are largely left to do their own thing in the background, and our protagonist is one of only 3 characters that are given the space to grow in this right and deftly written masterpiece.\nAnd, speaking of the writing \u2026 woah. Much of the action takes place on a boat, as you would expect from a land of tiny islands amidst an expansive ocean. This felt appropriate, as there\u2019s a flow and a lilt to Le Guin\u2019"}]}

We understand now the \"hows\" of everything Alexander Luthor has been planning, if not necessarily the \"whys.\" I'm glad to see all of the Countdown miniseries tied together, even Day of Vengeance, and the suggestion that the heroes will become more pro-active now, lead by Batman, portends good things for the rest of the series.\nUnfortunately, this issue felt very compressed to me, and with only three issues left to go, I'm afraid that the next three issues will feel compressed, too. There was a lot of great stuff here, almost on every page--dropping Chemo on Bludhaven, Crispus Allen becoming the Spectre, learning how all four Countdown miniseries finally tie in, a big shocking fight scene, and the return of Barry Allen and Max Mercury--but it all just seemed to come so quickly that it felt like some things got short-changed. For instance, apparently the beetle scarab is now attached to the new Blue Beetle's spine; maybe it would have been a waste of pages to show that actually happening, but when Booster Gold talked about it, I felt like I had missed something.

Vang, presents findings from the responses to those questions, which captured nine themes, including disruption of research, disconnection due to remote work, and inequities in the pandemic\u2019s impact on particular faculty.\nDownload the full report of our findings and presentation slides\nSee also: Recruitment and Retention, Webinars\nAssessing the Needs of Part-Time Faculty: Lessons Learned from the University at Buffalo\n(2019). Assessing the Needs of Part-Time Faculty: Lessons Learned from the University at Buffalo.\nAccording to the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), approximately 40% of all faculty across all institutional types are now part-time. This subset of adjunct faculty is fulfilling a critical role in the higher education landscape, yet the variability of these appointments makes it exceedingly difficult to assess their needs and, ultimately, provide adequate support.\nIn 2017, COACHE partners at the University at Buffalo set out to address this knowledge gap by adapting the Faculty Job Satisfaction Survey to suit the needs of their part-time faculty. In this webinar, Robert Granfield and Tilman Baumstark will share the challenges faced and lessons learned, both from their methodology and from their faculty, throughout this endeavor."}]}

This builds logic because the purpose of going on the voyage is to allow him to gain more experience and knowledge. By defining the benefits he will receive, Abigail Adams hopes that it will incline John Quincy Adams to earnestly participate in the voyage and prosper.\nAbigail Adam also uses allusion to strengthen her overall argument. The author alludes to Julius Caesar by asking, \u201cWould Cicero have shone so distinguished as an orator if he had not been roused, kindled, and inflamed by the tyranny Catiline, Verres, and Mark Antony?\u201d (line 30-32). She explains that Cicero succeeded as an orator despite the challenges he had encountered. Likewise, John Quincy Adams must overcome difficulties and overlook his unwillingness in order to achieve greatness. Abigail Adams hope that he understands that hard work will lead to progress and prosperity.\nAbigail Adam uses a thoughtful tone, a metaphor, and an allusion to strengthen her persuasion in hopes that John Quincy Adams will take her words of encouragement into consideration in order to strive and succeed as an individual.

This can act as both a blessing and a curse, as the metal handles of these pans are incredibly hot when used in an oven or broiler. With this in mind, it\u2019s essential to be mindful of a cast iron\u2019s handles and use oven mitts or something similar when holding it.\nBest cast iron pans\nSome top choices for cast iron skillets include the Victoria Cast Iron Frying Pan and the Lodge Seasoned Cast Iron 3 Skillet Bundle. The Victoria skillet has two side handles for easy handling and a spout to help with excess grease. The Lodge Cast Iron Skillet Bundle is an excellent choice for those looking for a cast iron set. The 8-, 10.5- and 12-inch skillets ensure maximum versatility for all types of dishes.\nStainless steel pans\nStainless steel is one of the most popular materials for cookware today. It\u2019s made through cladding, in which layers of metal (typically aluminum or copper) are bonded together to help heat evenly conduct throughout the cookware.\nLike cast iron pans, stainless steel pans are incredibly durable. Additionally, the pans contain chromium, which creates a passive layer of oxide on its exterior surface, ensuring protection against things like scratching or corrosion.\nWhat you\u2019ll love about stainless steel pans\nStainless steel pans are extremely versatile. They can be used to cook just about everything from breakfast options like eggs and bacon to dinners like meats and sauteed vegetables. Stainless steel pans are considered non-reactive, unlike cast iron pans, which means acidic foods like sauces and wine will not damage the exterior. Additionally, they can be used in any situation, from stovetop to oven use.\nUnlike cast iron pans, stainless steel pans don\u2019t need to be seasoned to be cleaned. They can be easily cleaned with soap and water and are usually dishwasher-safe.\nQuick heating\nSince they have a layered metal construction, stainless steel pans heat quickly."}]}

The usual objection is that it is too difficult to do well. Hands\u2019 prefers a deeper objection: there are \u201cno rational grounds\u201d for determining whether or not patriotism does more harm than good. Schools can therefore do no more than teach patriotism as a controversial subject, and allow pupils to decide for themselves. Hands\u2019 utilitarian case for staying on the fence on the value of patriotism as a social good is unconvincing. If we want civic, not ethnic, versions of national identity to underpin our common citizenship, then this depends on being in favour of the version of patriotism and belonging that we need. Most attention is given to the argument that patriotism clouds and impedes the judgement of citizens to do their civic duty, yet there has never been any shortage of projects for change \u2013 from Wilberforce and Equino\u2019s movement to abolish slavery, the US civil rights movement, or the \u201cnow win the peace\u201d case for post-war welfare \u2013 founded in patriotic critiques of the status quo.\nMost who think patriotism is worth getting off the fence for will also agree that the author\u2019s objection to patriotic indoctrination in schools is valid. But how many contemporary voices are promoting a tub-thumping and biased account of British history to re-establish or invent national myths? That would certainly be an unfair caricature of Education Secretary Michael Gove. His argument for an overarching sense of the narrative sweep of British history is surely compatible with teaching it, warts and all. What it does require is some priority to finding sufficient space in the curriculum for British history, alongside the European dictators, or Geronimo and the American West. And it depends too on getting over any fear that teaching the history of Empire and decolonisation openly and accurately will be divisive in multi-ethnic classrooms, when it is an essential foundation for understanding the history that has made us the society that we have become.<s> The Legend of Jerry Zifcak \u2013 The Pride of Burrillville Broncos Hockey\nJohn Zifcak was"}]}

Among all VD-vectors in \\(S \\cup S'\\), \\(X^3\\) is in fact the VD-vector that minimizes the sum and it follows that \\(d(\\pi ) = d(\\pi, X^3) = 18\\)\nTheorem 1 shows that computing the sorting distance for signed permutations, using cyclic SSOs, is in \\(\\mathsf {P}\\). From this, one can easily derive a polynomial-time algorithm for sorting signed circular permutations by SSOs: it suffices to cut the circular permutation (n different cuts are possible), and to decide which extremity is left and which is right (2 possible cases). Once this is done, we are left with a linear permutation, which can be sorted using cyclic SSOs using Algorithm 1. The sorting distance is the minimum value obtained by Algorithm 1 over the 2n possible linear permutations obtained from the circular one. Thus we have the following result.\nSorting signed circular permutations by SSOs is in \\(\\mathsf {P}.\\)\nComputing a sorting sequence\nAlgorithm 1 only returns the length of a minimum-length sorting sequence, not the sequence itself.

For this, we iteratively remove each edge from \\(G^X_{\\pi }\\) by applying a swap over two adjacent elements connected by an edge, and choosing between a 2-reversal or a 2-transposition so that the number of odd components does not increase, as shown in Lemma 3.

At the same time, the aim is to promote the diversity of higher education and a smoother work transition. The support of the universities has been found to promote both the progress of studies and skills important in studies. The purpose of this Master\u2019s thesis was to look at speech related to support for students on the autism spectrum at universities. The research material consisted of six interviews in which two career services employees, two university teachers, and both current and graduate students on the autism spectrum were interviewed. The interviews were originally part of the Improving Employability of Autistic Graduates in Europe (IMAGE) project. The six interviews were selected for use in this thesis together with the researcher involved in the project. The research material was analyzed by discourse analysis. As a result of the analysis, three discourses were outlined, which were named similarization discourse, individualization discourse, and individualistic discourse. The subject positions of students on the autism spectrum transitioning to work, were outlined through substance- and special skills and without individualistic agency. These subject positions did not fully meet the individualistic expectations of employers, or the support formed based on these expectations.\nKorkeakouluopiskelijoiden uupumuksen ehk\u00e4iseminen psykologisen joustavuuden avulla \ufeff\nPoranen, Nea (2022)\nMore and more university students are experiencing symptoms of burnout.

Without government support, that could drop to 36% by the end of this decade, according to the analysis released by U.S. industry body Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and Boston Consulting Group.\nThe United States has already lost its lead in chip manufacturing, prompting the Biden administration to pass the CHIPS and Science Act this year.

This is true in dolphins, a creature that we generally think of as happy, possibly because of the structure of their jaws that seem locked in a permanent smile. We picture dolphins being playful, jumping in and out of the water. However, this seemingly playful activity can actually be an aggressive behavior. When dolphins leap out of the ocean, it is often because they are fighting with other dolphins and breaking the water surface at high speeds to breathe. But there are other things that dolphins do that scientists believe are forms of play, such as riding on waves for no functional reason or passing around organic objects like seaweed, fish or sea turtles.\nSimilar behavior can be play in animals other than mammals. Fish, frogs and reptiles can have fun. Fish can leap over objects in the water for fun, frog tadpoles ride bubbles, adult frogs sometimes wrestle each other without sexual intentions, and komodo dragons, turtles, and crocodiles play with objects in ways similar to dogs.\nGiven the established role that play seems to have on mammals and other critters, it is surprising to think that invertebrates can also indulge in play. Previously, invertebrates were considered unintelligent and incapable of higher-level actions exhibited by animals with backbones. Yet, an ideal example of play in invertebrates is seen among cephalopods. Octopuses can be seen acting in an exploratory way towards objects by using their arms or siphons to move objects around or playing catch-and-release with their prey the same way a cat would with a mouse. Spiders, another invertebrate, have also been observed exhibiting play behavior. They also engage in non-functional sexual behavior that does not result in conception. At the moment, these observations are preliminary evidence to the argument that invertebrates, too, can play.\nSo why do these animals play? Play can stimulate creative behavior and is hypothesized to have originated when species developed the metabolic capacity as well as increased time and safety for extended activity without functional benefits.

With space at a premium at the back of an F1 car, compromises in packaging the various suspension elements need to be made. At its launch it was clear the Mercedes pull rod arrangement placed the rocker quite rearward, in comparison to other pull rod arrangements which place the rocker towards the front of the gear case. The conventional forward rocker placement, puts the heave spring and antiroll in the space at the front of the gear case, packaged around the clutch.\nIn Mercedes case the rocker is packaged the other side of the gear cluster, just under the gearboxes cross shaft. This leaves little room for the antiroll bar and heave spring. It does however place the rocker and torsion bars very low for the benefit of packaging, aero and CofG. Albeit these are small benefits, perhaps Mercedes choice of a short wheel base did not leave space for the suspension to be packaged around the clutch, as the gearbox length is a critical factor in wheelbase length.\nSo left with the lack of space to place either a mechanical heave element or a antiroll bar, it appears that Mercedes have opted to create a passive hydraulic system. This is not to be confused with any form of active suspension or the cars high pressure hydraulic systems, this system will be entirely self contained to remain within the rules on suspension design. As the system reacts only to suspension loads, it is clearly legal and there is no question of interpretation in its acceptance by the FIA.\nWhat Mercedes have in place of a conventional anti roll bar and heave spring are hydraulics units (yellow), which probably also act as the dampers.

Companies with 500 + employees are already using some form of HCMS. So, any replacement product like ours has to offer migration from existing system. After all we are offering the customer a better experience from a lesser experience.\nSecondly, we always exist in an ecosystem. It could be a Microsoft dynamic ecosystem, Oracle ecosystem and so on. With appropriate levels of control and permissions, any information can come into or go out of a product like Darwinbox to the existing systems. Examples may be the CRM system, Supply chain or Finance modules of the existing HCMS.

Brooks School of Public Policy\nStates that permit recreational use of cannabis see a reduction in demand for prescription codeine, an opioid with a high potential for misuse.\nPublished Jan. 19 in Health Economics, a new study finds a significant reduction in pharmacy-based codeine distribution in states that have legalized recreational cannabis use. The finding is promising from a public health policy perspective because misuse of prescription opioids annually contributes to more than 10,000 overdose deaths.\nTwenty-one U.S. states have passed recreational cannabis laws and legislatures in other states are considering similar measures.\n\u201cA reduction in the misuse of opioids will save lives,\u201d said doctoral candidate Shyam Raman who is affiliated with the Cornell Jeb E.

Manga genres can be roughly divided by age and gender of the reader, such as boys, girls, young adult, men, women, etc. Also, there are various genres by subject such as action, sci-fi, horror, mystery, love, comedy. . . and food. Often known as gourmet or cooking manga, this genre has become one of the popular genres. Although food is the central theme, the gourmet manga works are diverse and across different genres. Works can be comedy, action, romance, and/or history.\nCooking/Gourmet manga often focuses on a chef, those who cook food in restaurants. So, in this sense, they are manga for professionals who devote their lives to cooking. For example, Aji ichi monme depicts the growth process of a young chef working in a Japanese restaurant. When two chefs are in a contest against each other, the cooking/gourmet manga can be the story of battle. Boys manga depicts food battle stories which sometimes become ridiculously wild. As shown in Yakitate!! Japan, young, genius bread makers show off their extraordinary technique, which is often beyond the ability of human being, who create innovative food which tastes unworldly. The story may also focus on those who eat. The epicurean journalist in Oishinbo does not hesitate to reveal their deep knowledge of food ingredients, thereby providing the readers with the educational information on food. Some manga use food as communication tool. While depicting the daily life of the characters, the story shows what they cook and how they dine together, usually with the recipe of the featured meal. One extraordinary cookbook manga is Danjon-meshi, a fantasy manga which explains how to cook monsters living in a dungeon. Some historical manga introduces"}]}

In some cases this need arose from experience of the excessive use e.g. overexploited fishing resources, and in others from conflict between uses. No significant part of the world\u2019s coastal area is now without problems. (Kenchigton, 1990). Understanding the nature of conflicting uses of coastal resources, recognising the problem and being willing to do something about it provides a clearer basis for the management actions that follow.\nForemost, the emergence and formulation of coastal management approaches gathered pace in the 1970s. For some decades now, managing coasts has sought frameworks to accommodate changes resulting from global forces.\nDifferent systems abound across the globe, and are variously referred to as Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM), Coastal Zone Management (CZM), and Integrated Coastal Area Management (CAM). Here it is referred to as Coastal Area management because of the wish to emphasis the spatial perspective of multiple uses over the coastal space. Essentially Coastal Area Management is intended to replace the ad hoc crisis responses to marine resource problems with planned, anticipatory and integrated strategies. But to what degree are there frameworks appropriate, and do they achieve a strategic management level?\nCoastal Area Management is most simply understood as management of the CZ as a whole in relation to local, regional, national land international goals. The role of an integrated process and the benefits it brings is important to marrying the marine environment with the terrestrial. It may be defined as\n\u201can integrated or joined up approach towards the many different interest on both the land and marine components of the coasts. It is the process of harmonising the different policies and decision making structures, and bringing together coastal stakeholders to encourage concerted action towards achieving common goals\u201d (DEFRA).\nCoastal Area Management is inevitably a complex process, and the management and implementation, across every continent, is well documented with detailed analysis of demonstrative strengths and weaknesses.

While she is most definitely still being kicked around by the plot, she is most definitely an active participant in the story at this point and quite a fun one at that.

They are lined with feathers and even bits of fur. The three or four nestlings are fed food that the parents cached the previous year. By nesting early, the young get a head start on amassing the food stores they will need to get through their first winter.\nJuvenile gray jays are a sooty grey all over and almost look like they belong to a different species. In June, they begin a serious struggle for dominance. The young jays chase each other more and more aggressively until one of them will have expelled its siblings from the parents\u2019 territory. This more dominant bird will continue to live with its parents for two or three years, or until a nearby territory becomes available. This is why you often see gray jays in groups of three. Sometimes, however, the third bird is an \u201cejectee\u201d from another territory that is now living with unrelated adults. The weaker siblings are forced to leave the territory and most will die before winter arrives. This strange behaviour on the part of young jays makes evolutionary sense. They are probably not skilled enough to store sufficient food for their first-winter needs and have to rely on help from adult birds. It is unlikely, however, that there would be sufficient food for a second or third juvenile, hence the fight for dominance.\nGray jays are found from coast to coast in Canada and in all of our provinces and territories. In Ontario, their range extends from the edge of the tree line in the north to the last isolated spruce bogs where the Canadian Shield meets the Great Lakes \u2013 St. Lawrence Lowlands in the \u201cLand Between\u201d.\nHowever, you won\u2019t find gray jays in our towns and cities.

In other words, players can win a grand total of 50,000.00NZD . Even so, there are other opportunities to increase the number of winnings won without having to score the highest paid combination.\nThe key tips for scoring the biggest rewards in the gambling machine are through its Free Bonus Feature. This can only be activated when the player lands at least two or more of the Scatter, represented by the Devil\u2019s trident, on the leftmost reels. The more Scatters the player lands on the reels, the more extra games they will receive. It is during these rounds that all winning combinations are doubled until the extra games end. It is important to note that the jackpot and Wild symbols will have no effect during these special rounds.\nIf the player scores two Scatters, he/she wins a total of 5 free spins;\nThree of a kind wins a total of 10 free spins;\nFour of a kind wins a total of 20 free spins;\nFive Scatters altogether can win the player a huge total of 50 free spins.\nWhen used in betting strategies, applying the bonus rounds can be the best way to maximise the winnings instead of directly aiming towards the jackpot. For example, when winning the prizes from the coin symbol, where five rewards 300, this can be brought up to 600. Even the Wilds with their max prize of 5,000 can be brought up to 10,000 when won during a free spin. This can win the player 10,000.00NZD .\nSo Hot casino players will have an enjoyable and rewarding experience even if the features themselves are relatively simple. The graphics themselves are also rather humble, but this just makes the fire-styled art pop out even more. So Hot is designed towards those who don\u2019t want complex rules to spoil having good-old fashioned fun with gambling.

While we've seen great factory customs come to dominate the vintage Joe space, we've also a radical uptick in vintage pricing that's making the hobby much less fun since figures are now seen as valued commodities instead of the toys they are.

There's a well known strategy where you dump unpopular items at an unpopular time so that you don't waste the more valuable slots with content that isn't likely to generate any interest. With that in mind, I present the 1988 Windmill.\nWindmill has only been a part of my collection due to Funskool's take on the mold. With that figure in hand, there is simply no reason to look elsewhere for the character. But, the Indian figure exists because Hasbro sculpted this figure in the late 1980's and tossed him into a vehicle. Windmill is a far cry from the days of Crankcase, Heavy Metal, or even Backstop. He's not the worst figure in the line. But, he's in the discussion. The figure's colors, design and overall sculpting show a slippage in the quality Joe aficionados had come to expect. In reality, Windmill was nothing more than another example of the diminished paint applications that were the hallmark of the entire 1988 series. But, to a collector who only discovered him as an adult, Windmill has an insurmountable amount of detriments in his way to ever gaining appreciation.\nI'm not real sure what happened with the 1988 vehicle drivers...at least on the Joe side. The Cobras are passable and not really any worse than other years. But, the Joes really took a turn for the worse. Skidmark and Windmill introduce bright green and orange to the pantheon"}]}

And, since a 3D representation on a 2D screen can be confusing, it means the core of the interface should be in 2D. This affects the design, which also starts with a 2D existence. We played with a dotted line, which is a very common 2D representation. Using Illustrator, we applied the same thickness, but modifying the gaps to achieve a specific tone or a unique rhythm in a dotted line. This was then transformed into press fit connections in 3D. The process went back and forth, like a ping-pong game between 2D and 3D in the design, interface, detailing, decoration, manufacturing and assembly. The ping-ponging gave it a specific character. It created a certain visual language that is recognizable. Whatever you do with Box-o-rama it will always be Box-o-rama.\nHV: The interesting part of dealing with digital media is that they have their own limits. They give input into how they would structure the design, which is interesting for developing new products. The biggest and most difficult aspect is that there\u2019s no sense of touch involved. You get into this virtual world and there are only fragments of the real thing. We love the gravity tool, which comes into play in Box-o-rama when customers put boxes on top of each other. Gravity is introduced in a digital sense and it\u2019s one of the first steps for getting a feeling for the object. The other interesting thing is that the tool makes decisions of its own, making some options impossible. It ensures that one cannot order something that cannot exist.\nHow do you feel about opening up design to customers?\nHV: We treated the assignment as a way to communicate not only the possibility for a consumer to be able to transform the design and to make his own stuff, but also to communicate about our office and our attitude towards open design. This system is not star designer based. Making a framework instead of defined and finished products is where I see the difference between star design and non-star design.\nHow do you think people will react?\nHV: Knowledge is still transported through humans, institutes, or some other kind of \u201creal world\u201d channel.

But if we consider the Matter in itself, the Tranquillity of a Mind, free from Anger, is not a moral Defect. For supposing, what is very seldom to be found, a Man either naturally or by the Force of long Custom so hard to be moved, that he is seldom or never angry, he is thus very happy, as being secured from the Excesses of a blind Passion; nor will such a Man be less disposed, or less able to maintain his just Rights, and that of his Friends. On the contrary, by being Master of his Passions, and of a peaceable Disposition, he will be able to take more just Measures, and manage his Interest better than those, who are actuated by a Passion so hard to govern as Anger. Though Anger is not evil in its own Nature, and may be allowed to a certain Point, it is never absolutely necessary. We always may, and that with more Security, support our Dignity and maintain our Right, without being in a Passion. But it is evident that our Philosopher makes a Virtue of a moderate Degree of Anger, and a Desire of Revenge, the natural Effect of that Passion; which being in itself vitious, never allows Anger to be kept within due Bounds.\n[1 ] He speaks in the following Manner of Justice, properly so called, which he terms particular or private, to distinguish it from universal or general Justice, including the Practice of all the Virtues which relate to our Neighbour.

But they wanted to include the family, too, so they approached the team at Farr Yacht Design with a broad brief: Keep or even improve the performance of the highly successful First 40.7, but include all the requisite elements of a family-friendly cruiser, including lounging spaces in the cockpit, a well-appointed interior, and viable systems for extended coastal voyages.\nFarr\u2019s designers achieved this through clever convertibility, most obviously seen is the removable cockpit seats/stowage lockers. For the Wednesday-night races, these are left at the dock, opening up a no-frills cockpit with ample room for a full racing crew. Once reattached, the lockers are long enough to be comfortable seats and large enough to hold all the toys and tools central to an extended family cruise. Likewise, the helm seat, which runs gunwale to gunwale across the open transom, acts as a secure enclosure when cruising, but on race nights, this, too, stays behind to create more space and easy access to the backstay adjuster.\nA double-ended mainsheet system operates off a wide athwartship traveler forward of the helm. The towering triple-spreader aluminum rig holds a generous 1,055 square feet of working sail. A ballast-to-displacement ratio of .42, with the ballast residing mostly in the 8-foot-deep lead bulb, ensures that the boat stands up to this sail plan. Both the D/L ratio of 166 and the SA/D ratio (100%) of 21.5 validate Beneteau\u2019s prediction of up to a 15-second-per-mile improvement over the already fast First 40.7.

A crucial underlying assumption, however, is that the mediating scalar field has negligible self-interactions. As argued in gubserkhoury , the addition of a quartic term drastically changes the picture. Gravitational-strength coupling to matter is allowed again, even with a quartic coupling as small as \u223c10\u221253 nelson . The ability for self-interacting scalars to hide from experiments relies on the chameleon mechanism original ; gubserkhoury , which suppresses fifth-force signals in two ways.\nFigure 1: Current experimental constraints on the strength \u03b1 and range L (in meters) of a Yukawa fifth force, ignoring self-interactions. Reprinted from adellong .\nFirstly, the presence of ambient matter density generates a tadpole term in the Klein-Gordon equation, which shifts the minimum of the potential. Because of the quartic coupling, the mass of small fluctuations around this effective minimum can be much larger than the mass in vacuum. This is most emphatically illustrated with a massless field with quartic coupling of order unity: in a medium of density 1 g/cm3, the effective mass is 0.1 mm.\nSecondly, the fifth force is further suppressed by the thin shell effect, another startling consequence of the nonlinearity of the field equations. Within a dense macroscopic body, the effective mass of the scalar is large. As a result, the contribution of the core to the external field is exponentially small. Only a thin shell near the surface exerts a significant pull on an exterior test particle. In fact, for an infinite plate, the force at the surface eventually saturates as the thickness is increased, causing the strength relative to gravity to fall off rapidly.\nIt follows that an ideal experiment to detect a chameleon-like scalar must: 1. use sufficiently small test masses to minimize the thin shell suppression; and 2. probe the force at distances mm to avoid the exponential damping from the effective mass. These considerations point towards the E\u00f6t-Wash experiment at the University of Washington hoyle .\nIn this paper we carefully assess the ability of the E\u00f6t-Wash experiment to detect or exclude chameleon scalar fields with quartic self-interactions."}]}

Still, unequal access to COVID-19 vaccines, tests and treatments is rampant, prolonging the pandemic. 23 countries are yet to fully vaccinate 10% of their populations, 73 countries are yet to achieve 40% coverage and many more are projected to miss the 70% target by middle of this year.\nThe biggest challenges are in low-income countries (LICs), which are concentrated in Africa.

The film opens with narration telling us that when The Devil was cast from Heaven he vowed to get revenge by ruling earth and every 600 years his minions, The Gargoyles would rise up to attempt to do so. We then focus on Dr. Mercer Boley (Cornel Wilde), a scientist and author who specializes in the study of man\u2019s belief in demons, traveling in the desert with his hot photographer daughter Diana (Jennifer Salt) to see a man who claims to have found something of interest. Uncle Willie (Woody Chamblis) is an old man running a middle of nowhere roadside attraction and shows the pair a bizarre skeleton that looks like some kind of man-sized flying, horned lizard. Boley thinks it a fraud, but agrees to hear the old man\u2019s tale of the local Native American legends telling of the tribes battling such creatures.

They didn\u2019t need to ask me twice. Below are my impressions from a week in Sin City with the watch.\nThe watch makes an immediate impression with its famous octagonal case \u2014 another contribution to watch design history by the legendary G\u00e9rald Genta, whose other horological brainchildren include the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak and Patek Philippe Nautilus. The combo of shiny black and matte black with polished rose gold and brushed rose gold is appealing as one might expect. The multi-layered Octo case catches the eye with its brushed-finish round bezel layered over the octagonal, polished-finish base.\nThe multifaceted, multilevel case is all sharp angles and smooth, straight edges and yet is extremely comfortable on the wrist and also not excessively large or heavy, though not every wearer might agree with me here. I can report that the watch, at about 13 mm in thickness, did not have a problem staying discreetly tucked under any of my dress shirt cuffs, not that I was all that concerned with hiding it from admiring eyes. The polished black dot inset into the rose-gold screw-down crown was a nice touch; even nicer was the use of gold screws to anchor the black DLC caseback around the see-through window.\nIt\u2019s best if you\u2019re not overly concerned with the date, as it is tucked away, quite unobtrusively, between the 4 and 5 o\u2019clock indices and can be easily overlooked but not so easily discerned in low lighting. The white type on black background makes the small date numeral blend seamlessly with the rest of the dial, but here\u2019s a case where the design blasphemy of a less elegant, black-numerals-on-white-background date window may have improved legibility. (One stops worrying about the day and date quite easily while running around to and from events and appointments in Las Vegas, so this was not, frankly, something, that caused me much concern during my review period.)\nFor those uninitiated in the corporate hierarchies of watch brands, Bulgari shares corporate"}]}

Most of the animal kingdom practice placentophagy, which is the act of the mother eating the placenta after birth. Such practice by humans is limited to homeopathic birth coaches who believe it wards off post-partum depression. The placenta is gathered, dried, then encapsulated and consumed in capsule form.\nSeveral celebrities seem to have picked up the cause. Tom Cruise joked about doing so before Katie Holmes gave birth to Siri. January Jones admitted doing so in January 2012. However, public reaction is universally negative. Tom Cruise was in one of his... weird periods back then and the interview cannot be taken seriously, and ABC News ran an article \"Mad Mom?\", a pun of January Jones' role on the TV series \"Mad Men\". (link no longer active)\nHuman placenta is a VERY rare ingredient in Chinese herbal medicine (link is in Chinese), believed to nourish the blood. The official law in China declares placenta to be a medical waste and CANNOT be sold without permission of the mother. That doesn't stop some unscrupulous folks from selling it as a black market item. In many cultures, the placenta is buried in a ceremony after birth to thank it for fulfilling its mission to bring the baby into this world. Thus, eating it would be sacrilegious, and may be considered a form of cannibalism.\nCannibalism is universally considered a taboo as it is counter to the survival of the Homo Sapien species.\nHistorical and Social Perspective\nHistorians pointed out that the propaganda portraying someone as heartless evildoers willing to mutilate the dead is nothing new. The infamous \"German Tallow Factory\" hoax of World War I was a prime example, when the British spread disinformation through their official newspapers about how the Huns (derogatory term for Germans) are making soap out of their own war dead, and attributing it to Belgian sources.\nIt is also the perfect urban legend... just nasty enough"}]}

After all, atomic weaponry is simply not practical if it results in your own total destruction. So-called 'limited' military action between the great powers carries the risks of ultimate escalation and suddenly it's - 'Wham Bam, thanks, Ma'am'!\nBut economic warfare is, by comparison, infinitely more gradual and certainly far removed from loony generals pressing buttons. However, the end results can be catastrophic. One of the unsung contributions to victory in 1918 was the British naval blockade which exerted a strangulating pressure on the German economy forcing them into unrestricted submarine warfare whose only result was to bring into the front line a million or so fresh-faced, well-fed Americans to face a German army on quarter rations!\nThe result of the recent bout of tit-for-tat economic sanctions between Russia and the West is worth watching carefully. Like all warfare, the cost/benefit analysis is a fine one and in fact only experience will confirm who is better placed to survive through an economic war although my money is on capitalist countries with relatively free markets.

Her lift was filled with watching her little brothers, which would have been alright if each parent had not 'claimed' one brother each and raised them seperately in a sense. Each brother raised to the parents specifications, and Adelaide in the middle a part of both world but neither falling into either. She grew up very much trying to be the bridge in her parents relationship. To bridge their talents and her brothers lives. She was a dreamer, a fantasizer, and believed that world was generally a good place.

Bloody Hell was the CLEAR winner, though.\nBloody Hell is the story of a man who serves 8 years in prison for thwarting a bank robbery (the story unfolds throughout the movie) and then vacations in Finland at the end of his sentence to get away from the press. The lead is Ben O\u2019Toole, giving a hell of a dual role, and the story is a joy. Just a complete blast here.\nMotherly is also good, if a bit predictable, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the road to the climax is worth it, and the final act is both chilling and darkly humorous. If you have to choose between this and Bloody Hell, watch BH. But if you don\u2019t? See them both!\nIn the wake of Grotesque, the next cult movie watch party was Girls Nite Out, which is not a fitting title. It\u2019s another 80\u2019s slasher without the mayhem of Grotesque. It\u2019s pretty straight forward until you get to the end, which will no doubt make you think of another more famous slasher that actually came AFTER GNO, but did what it does so much better.\nI heard from many people that Orphan: First Kill was another nutso horror offering with a crazy turn. I mean\u2026 it DOES take a turn, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a completely bizarre or noteworthy one. Still, it\u2019s not bad by any stretch (though the camera work and weird shots to make you think Isabelle Fuhrman has not grown up since the predecessor are obnoxious), and it\u2019s great to see Julia Styles still doing stuff.\nSamaritan is very much like Motherly in that you see everything coming from over an hour out, but that didn\u2019t really hurt the ride for me. I will say that whereas Motherly had its best act as the third despite the lack of surprise, Samaritan\u2019s third act was the worst because they could have made the reveal a bit better.\nSt"}]}

Through an arrangement with a private institution known as Marshall Academy the Seminary was housed in the academy building. Students who needed further preparation in academic subjects were to obtain this in the academy. This arrangement failed to work out satisfactorily; so the theological group moved to a private dwelling, where classes continued until 1872. In the autumn of that year the Seminary was removed to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where a building had been erected for its use. In"}]}

From Alicante: Valencia Full-Day Guided Tour\nWe will discover the work of the Valencian architect Santiago Calatrava, who has several buildings that have become icons of the city. It is a scientific and cultural leisure complex better known as the City of Arts and Sciences. We will discover the very Holy Chalice inside the Cathedral, feel the emotion in the Basilica of the Virgin of the Forsaken and get to know the Central Market with all its stalls full of top-quality fresh food. Rest enjoying some tapas in the sun on one of its terraces and continue with the Lonja de la Seda, a jewel of civil Gothic. And, if you have any strength left, you cannot miss the so-called Valencian Sistine Chapel: The Church of San Nicol\u00e1s. We will finish the tour centre in \"La Albufera de Valencia\" which was declared a natural park in 1986; however, its history goes back much further in time. Before returning to Alicante we will make a stop to captivate ourselves with its splendor and its charm that attracts unprecedented fauna and flora.

The need for suitable and sustainable analytical methods for direct multi-elemental analysis of plant samples has been increased in recent years. Spectrometric techniques for direct sample analysis, instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) have been applied in environmental studies and various fields of screening tests. Nevertheless, these techniques are not commonly used for plant sample analysis and their performances need to be evaluated. This research aimed to assess how reliable non-destructive techniques are in the determination of elements in plants compared to conventionally used spectrometric techniques. A total of 49 plant samples of four conifer species (Pinus nigra, Abies alba, Taxus baccata and Larix decidua) were measured using two conventionally applied (ICP-MS, ICP-OES) and two non-destructive techniques (wavelength dispersive XRF (WD-XRF), INAA). The comparison was performed by investigation of relative ratios of concentrations and by correlation analysis. Moreover, precision of the techniques was examined and compared. The quality control included analysis of NIST pine needles certified reference material (1575a) using all examined techniques.

Around two dozen participants across the trade press found their way digitally to an exciting event on 15 March 2022, where (almost) everything revolved around the climate-neutral circular economy.\nAlmost everything, because Ingemar B\u00fchler (photo top left), CEO of Plastics Europe Germany and host of the event, also began by saying a few words about Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which of course could not go unmentioned \u2013 not only for reasons of the impact on supply chains and co \u2013 could not remain unmentioned. A turning point in time, which also illustrates how important it is that our industry follows the path of decoupling from fossil raw materials more consistently and courageously, and that resources are circulated more efficiently overall. PET-recycled \u2013 Circular-Economy\nDr Henning Wilts (photo top centre), head of the circular economy department at the Wuppertal Institute, kicked off the day with his presentation \u201cClimate-neutral industry? Circular economy as a key strategy\u201d. In addition to the enormous opportunities, he also emphasised how difficult the path to this goal still is \u2013 despite excellent theoretical debate, criteria catalogues and innovative research projects. At the moment, Dr Wilts explained, there is simply too little being implemented. In the context of a sharp increase in total resource consumption worldwide, which is causing high CO2 emissions and massive species extinction, it is high time to get down to implementation.\nThis is where Sabine Nadherny-Borutin (photo top right), Secretary General of PlasticsEurope Austria, picked up.

Consistency from him every night should take this team to newer heights. The Wizards are characterized by their young backcourt, and that often leaves room for people to overlook him.

According to Sussman, his students spend most of their time reading manuals for these libraries to figure out how to stitch them together to get a job done.

What you do need is some amount of time spent on the idea that computer programs are mathematical objects which can be reasoned about mathematically. This is the part that the vast majority of people are missing nowadays, and it can be a little tricky to wrap your brain around at first.

The conviction came partially as a result of unsubstantiated testimony of a convict, who was incarcerated at the time of the killings, that Reeves and Kitchen were drug dealers and that Mr. Kitchen admitted in a phone call with him in prison to killing the victims over a drug debt. No independent evidence was offered at trial that Mr. Reeves ever dealt drugs.\nMr. Kitchen was sentenced to death for the crime, partially due to the confession he gave after being beaten by Detective Michael Kill, a subordinate of former Chicago Police Commander Jon Burge. Commander Burge has been indicted by the US Attorney\u2019s Office in Chicago for perjury related to alleged torture under his command. In addition to this abuse, the defense argued that prosecutors failed to turn over exculpatory evidence during their trials, specifically that, in exchange for his testimony, the witness had been put in work release and his girlfriend was given cash to move into a larger apartment where she could live with the witness.\nMr. Reeves\u2019 attorney, Mayer Brown partner Michael J.

This could easily change if Bitcoin becomes a popular way to share child sexual abuse material. Simply having these illegal images on your hard drive is a felony, which could have significant repercussions for anyone involved in Bitcoin.\nWhichever scenario plays out, this may be the Achilles heel of Bitcoin as a global currency.\nIf an open network such as a blockchain were threatened by a powerful organization\u2014China\u2019s censors, Disney\u2019s lawyers, or the FBI trying to take down a more dangerous botnet\u2014it could fragment into multiple networks. That\u2019s not just a nuisance, but an existential risk to Bitcoin.\nSuppose Bitcoin were fragmented into 10 smaller blockchains, perhaps by geography: one in China, another in the US, and so on. These fragments might retain their original users, and by ordinary logic, nothing would have changed. But Metcalfe\u2019s law implies that the overall value of these blockchain fragments combined would be a mere tenth of the original. That is because the value of an open network relates to how many others you can communicate with\u2014and, in a blockchain, transact with. Since the security of bitcoin currency is achieved through expensive computations, fragmented blockchains are also easier to attack in a conventional manner\u2014through a 51 percent attack\u2014by an organized attacker. This is especially the case if the smaller blockchains all use the same hash function, as they would here.\nTraditional currencies are generally not vulnerable to these sorts of asymmetric threats. There are no viable small-scale attacks against the US dollar, or almost any other fiat currency. The institutions and beliefs that give money its value are deep-seated, despite instances of currency hyperinflation.\nThe only notable attacks against fiat currencies are in the form of counterfeiting. Even in the past, when counterfeit bills were common, attacks could be thwarted. Counterfeiters require specialized equipment and are vulnerable to law enforcement discovery and arrest. Furthermore, most money today\u2014even if it\u2019s nominally in a fiat currency\u2014doesn\u2019t exist in paper form.\nBitcoin attracted a following for its openness and immunity from government control.

A difference in the substrate thickness is detected based on then obtained FE signal amplitude, FE signal symmetry, number of s-shaped waveforms of an FE signal, and focus driving value (focus-achieved voltage value) to discriminate between a BD, a DVD and a CD.\nWhile the spindle motor is kept OFF in this embodiment, the spindle motor 304 may be turned ON when it is desired to save the operation time. Or, the spindle motor 304 may be turned OFF only when the BD laser is driven to perform focus measurement. In this way, it is possible to prevent the objective lens 210 for BDs from coming into contact with the optical disk 301.\nWhen a voltage is supplied to the focus driving coil 305 to bring the objective lenses 210, 220 closer to the optical disk 301 from a distance to the same, a focus error value (FE value) is measured. In the measurement result, the FE values are represented in an s-curve as shown in FIG. 2(b).

Kelly termed it a twisted knee and said that doctors didn't see \"anything major.\"\n\"We're not concerned at all,\" Kelly said.\nKelly also said that defensive end Tony Springmann will miss the season because of knee surgery.\nSophomore offensive tackle Ronnie Stanley, who is in the mix to win a starting job, sat out Thursday's practice because of a"}]}

When split, secure domains are established and hardware mailboxes and semaphores are used for interprocessor communications.\nAdditionally, software functions can be divided between the two cores. This can be advantageous in applications requiring software certification (e.g. FAA for aviation or FDA for medical) where segmenting functions and having a clear, but physically limited communication path across domains, can reduce both risk of bugs and certification testing rigor and expense. This includes physically different nonvolatile storage devices for the M4 and A9, which enables segmentation and separation of operating system and application code, as well as data. On the Fury-X, M4 code can be stored in the processor\u2019s internal memory or QSPI flash while A9 code is typically stored within eMMC flash memory.\nThe M4/A9 architecture also enables fast system boot. The M4 can complete boot and start executing application code within tens of millisecondswhile the A9 boots a more complex operating system, such asLinux, which can require 20 to 30 seconds. Therefore, the M4 can commence device critical operations or simple display output while the A9 completes boot.\nThe Fury-X: Board Architecture Made for Networking and Rugged Deployment\nThe 6SoloX heterogeneous architecture enables efficient implementation of applications when both microcontroller and a microprocessor are appropriately utilized. However, the circuitry surrounding the processor must be supportive of its capabilities to take advantage of power optimization, security, and application. The Fury-X does just that.\nFirst, to enable network connectivity, Fury-X provides wired Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee interfaces and a mPCIe slot for expansion modules, such as cellular modems. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee are implemented in a single radio capable of running the full network stacks, allowing either the M4 or A9 cores to manage communications. Both Bluetooth and ZigBee are optional; the Fury-X can be ordered with a Wi-Fi only module for cost savings. Fury-X Wi-Fi includes enterprise-level security.\nThe 6SoloX includes two Gigabit Ethernet MACs and can provide a switching function without the addition of a switch IC"}]}

The Cascades are a natural laboratory to study the influence of the crust on erupted magmas and subterranean reservoirs. The interaction of ascending magmas with the variable subduction geometry and tectonics of the overriding North American plate has given rise to a diversity of magmatic storage conditions. The confluence of geochemical and geophysical investigations emphasizes that most magmatic systems in the Cascades have been built at multiple levels in the crust, as determined by tectonics, pre-existing structure, and magmatic flux from the mantle.\nBy Nicole E. Moore and Lynn Robinson\nThe Cascadia subduction zone continuously shapes the landscape of the Pacific Northwest of North America and the cultures of its inhabitants. The impacts of subduction processes on Pacific Northwest societies and cultures are varied, but Native Americans and European settler cultures alike have described geological processes through oral histories and have relied on resources provided by the subduction zone. Indigenous peoples focus many aspects of their religious practices and art around the geohazards of the Cascadia region, and our melded modern cultures continue to take part in storytelling related to subduction zone hazards through movies and other forms of narration.\nBy Elizabeth G.

We address each of them, beginning with whether the energy intensity of producing all materials used in batteries or that of battery assembly is greater. Notably, battery assembly energy intensity depends on assembly facility throughput because energy consumption of equipment, especially the dry room, is mainly throughput-independent. Low-throughput facilities therefore will have higher energy intensities than near-capacity facilities. In our analysis, adopting an assembly energy intensity reflective of a low-throughput plant caused the assembly stage to dominate cr"}]}

New business growth also remained down, while job creation slipped to the weakest since September. Sharp increases were seen in construction, wholesale & retail, and travel & tourism. New work received by construction firms rose at the strongest rate in nearly two years. Firms were less upbeat about future activity levels in December, with positivity slipping to a four-month low. Employment opportunities in December failed to rise due to weaker output forecasts.

Notably, we detected a single base mutation causing loss-of-function of the FLOWERING LOCUS C protein, responsible for the transition to early flowering in high-elevation populations.\nOur results provide a genome-wide perspective of how plants adapt to distinct environmental conditions across extreme elevation differences and the potential for further follow-up research with extensive data from additional populations and species.\nA cornerstone of biodiversity is that different species occupy specific ecological niches [1]. Each species has a range of distribution; some species are very narrow, and some can be widely distributed around the world [2, 3]. Altitude gradient, as an important index of spatial niche measurement, greatly affects the distribution range and pattern of organisms. Climate conditions vary greatly in different altitude regions [4]. Compared with low-altitude areas, high-altitude areas often have extreme environments including low temperature, low oxygen, poor soils, and strong ultraviolet (UV) radiation [5]. Only very few species can live across an elevation range greater than 4000 m from sea level to high altitude. Understanding how these species adapt to different environments with such a large altitude span can make a significant contribution to evolutionary ecology. It is difficult to demonstrate how wild species adapt to their local environments without genomics tools, because the mechanisms of ecological adaptation are very complex and involve multi-gene interactions at the genomic level rather than single-gene mutations [6, 7]. Previous genome-wide studies on adaptive evolution in distinct environments with great altitude differences have focused mainly on humans and vertebrates [8, 9]. Recently, several studies have reported the genetic architectures and evolutionary processes driving the adaption of alpine plants along altitudinal gradients [10,11,12]. However, local adaptation of alpine plants across the extreme altitude gradient (~\u20094000\u2009m) on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is very scarce.\nField pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) is an annual diploid (2n ="}]}

The relaxed energy evident in this authority emanated from all four corners of the Jerry Bergonzi Quartet Sunday at Bar Centro. This allowed many outlets of excitement, ideas, passion and soulful style.

It\u2019s a terse four-note phrase, extended slightly. Bergonzi asserted a powerful Trane-ish tight-reed tone that allowed fiery expression through discipline. Yet it helped the band warm up their chops perfectly.

A compatible API, on the other hand, allows compiled object code to function without any changes, on any system implementing that API. This is beneficial to both software providers (where they may distribute existing software on new systems without producing/distributing upgrades) and users (where they may install older software on their new systems without purchasing upgrades), although this generally requires various software libraries implementing the necessary APIs too.\nMicrosoft has shown significant commitment to a backward compatible API, particularly within their Windows API (Win32) library, such that older applications may run on newer versions of Windows. Apple Inc. has shown less propensity to this concern, breaking compatibility or implementing an API in a slower \"emulation mode\"; this allows greater freedom in development, at the cost of making older software obsolete.\nAmong Unix-like operating systems, there are many related but incompatible operating systems running on a common hardware platform (particularly Intel 80386-compatible systems). There have been several attempts to standardise the API such that software vendors may distribute one binary application for all these systems; however to date, none of these have met with much success.

Weprinted colour-calibrated stimuli of these faces, reproducing stimuli perceptually the same in colour and luminance to the original appearance of females. These images were presented to males who were either unfamiliar or familiar with stimuli females. Overall, males distinguished ovulatory from pre-ovulatory faces.

I owe. It's off to work I go.\" Well, that's what many -- including many Christians -- think of work. Find out about the goodness of work. What does Labor Day mean? For most of us, it's nothing more than a welcome break from what we tend to see as \"the daily grind.\" Work to so many people is simply a necessary evil. The goal in life is putting in enough time to retire and relax. But that attitude and that goal is contrary to a Christian worldview perspective on work. Christians have a special reason to celebrate Labor Day, which honors the fundamental dignity of workers, because we worship a God Who labored to make the world\u2014and Who created human beings in His image to be His workers. When God made Adam and Eve, He gave them work to do: cultivating and caring for the earth. In the ancient world, the Greeks and Romans looked upon manual work as a curse, something for lower classes and slaves. But Christianity changed all of that. Christians viewed work as a high calling\u2014a calling to be co-workers with God in unfolding the rich potential of His creation. This high view of work can be traced throughout the history of the Church. In the Middle Ages, the guild movement grew out of the Church. It set standards for good workmanship and encouraged members to take satisfaction in the results of their labor. The guilds became the forerunner of the modern labor movement. Later, during the Reformation, Martin Luther preached that all work should be done to the glory of God. Whether ministering the Gospel or scrubbing floors, any honest work is pleasing to the Lord. Out of this conviction grew the Protestant work ethic. Christians were also active on behalf of workers in the early days of the industrial revolution, when factories were \"dark satanic mills,\" to borrow a phrase from Sir William Blake. In those days, work in factories and coal mines was hard and dangerous. Men, women, and children were practically slaves\u2014sometimes even chained to machines. Then John Wesley came preaching and teaching"}]}

Which might also suggest that Ari was told to leak one thing, and more trustworthy leakers (Rove and Libby and ?) were told to leak another. Reviewing Cooper's first story on this, it does appear that he got the \"emphasize Tenet\" line, rather than the Ari line (if it is different, which I agree it may not be):\nA source close to the matter says that Wilson was dispatched to Niger because Vice President Dick Cheney had questions about an intelligence report about Iraq seeking uranium and that he asked that the CIA get back to him with answers. Cheney's staff has adamantly denied and Tenet has reinforced the claim that the Vice President had anything to do with initiating the Wilson mission. They say the Vice President merely asked routine questions at an intelligence briefing and that mid-level CIA officials, on their own, chose to dispatch Wilson.\nWilson tells the story differently and in a crucial respect.

I used to place the hook near the rear end. But it turns out trout (at least) attack bait fish \"near the center of gravity\" of the prey. In other words they tend to bite bait fish right behind the shoulders of the gills. I doubt a roadkill looks like a baitfish. But I do get fewer missed strikes with the hook mounted at mid-strip.\nTo the eye of the hook I attach an eight to fifteen pound-test shock tippet with an improved clinch knot. Then I poke a hole in the fur strip half-way between the eye of the hook andthe front end of the fur. I thread the shock tippet thought the hole in the middle of the fur strip, and then throw an overhand clinch knot around the front end of the fly.This fly can be tied in your hands, without thread or the aid of a fly tying vise. I carry a box of hooks and a hunk of fur in my tackle box, and never have to worry about running out of flies.\nBecause the bulk of the fly is tied around a flexible piece of monofilament, a Roadkill Streamer swims and corkscrews through the water with a more lively and critter-like fashion than a fly that is tied on a straight-shank hook. More complex patterns are also possible. Additional clinch knots with the monofilament shock tippet, or fly tying thread and a thread bobbin can be used to add yarn, flashabou, hackle or chain-bean embellishments to the front end of the fly. Double fur strips can be used to create a two-tone fly.<s> Hi My account"}]}

It was the story that has been built and allows the natural progression of the Thor Odinson to continue walking down.\nAt the same time, even if you have not read Aaron\u2019s Thor run yet War Of The Realms was not inaccessible.

There was no place to land here despite the fact the swell was now virtually irrelevant again as the shoals had passed through took their force.\nLooking at the GPS map I could see there was a kind of breakwater some 2 km east along the coast into this strong force 6 wind. With the light starting to fade I decided to aim for this breakwater at the hamlet of Indre Fure. As I paddled up the rocky coast I saw nowhere to land at all. Progress was slow due to the wind and I was having to dig deep and strain my sinews to move up the coast. Eventually I was the breakwater and pulled round it.\nI have occasionally had some surprises when figuring out places to stay from the map. Nothing quite matched Indre Fure. Here on the other side of this small breakwater was a beautiful white beach. Above the beach was a cluster of very nice buildings and houses in a green landscape. The houses were all surrounded with masses of plants and flowers, especially roses which were all in full bloom. It was an exceptionally idyllic sight. It was as if I had walked through a wardrobe door into a different world.\nI landed the kayak on the beach and found a nice camp spot just above it. There was no one around and I put up the tent. I was now after 2200 and the last light of the day was just lingering. A lady appeared from the nicest house and I went over to explain. She and her husband were one of three families who lived here. Like many small places in Norway they had the same surname of the hamlet. They were Kjell and Marit Fure. I chatted with her for 10 minutes until it the drizzle and wind drove her in again and I went to the tent. I crashed out straight away"}]}

TNC over-expression is repeatedly observed in several cancer tissues and promotes several processes in tumor progression. Until quite recently, more needs to be known about the potential mechanisms of TNC as a key player in cancer progression and metastasis. Materials and Methods: In the present study, we performed a bioinformatics analysis of breast and colorectal cancer expression microarray data to survey TNC role and function with holistic view. Gene expression profiles were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal samples and cancer biopsy samples. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of the DEGs with CluePedia plugin of Cytoscape software were constructed. Furthermore, after PPI network construction, gene-regulatory networks analysis was performed to predict long noncoding RNAs and microRNAs associated with TNC and cluster analysis was performed. Using the Clue gene ontology (GO) plugin of Cytoscape software, the GO and pathway enrichment analysis were performed. Results: PPI and DEGs-miRNA-lncRNA regulatory networks showed TNC is a significant node in a huge network, and one of the main gene with high centrality parameters.

Gary Cziko makes the case that it is analogous to evolution by natural selection in his book Without Miracles. This case is expanded in wonderful detail in a chapter in Dawkins & Ridley\u2019s \u2018Oxford Surveys in Evolutionary Biology\u2019 by Ted Cloak. The same author has updated his work in an video-supported online article that provides a mechanism for cultural evolution through what has been termed the \u2018meme\u2019 (Dawkins, 1976).\nThere is an emerging view that evolution is essentially a process of negative feedback control. An even more radical and exciting perspective informed by PCT is that because organisms are partly responsible for driving their own direction of evolution \u2013 \u2018evolution on purpose\u2019 (Corning, 2013). Powers himself wrote a compelling case for the origin of life as the emergence of control within chains of biochemicals.\nWarren Mansell makes the case for the links between Darwin\u2019s approach to evolution and the approach of PCT to psychology in a recent talk:https://www.youtube.com/embed/vQ3lY1U60MM\nIt is one thing to say that PCT is analogous to processes in biology. In the book Behavior: The Control of Perception Bill suggests that it is more than simply an analogy. He explains how neurones can be arranged to operate as control systems. The above illustration taken from Behaviour: The Control of Perception provides one example. Powers (1999) describes a computer model of arm movement that illustrates the physiological and physical basis of PCT. This model has been updated and available to download on Bill Powers\u2019 home page. Interestingly, Powers\u2019 description of the physiological basis of PCT resonates with early work of John Hughlings Jackson and Nikolai Bernstein. As such, to some extent, it converges with contemporary work on the equilibrium point hypothesis. A 1973 paper by Martin Taylor on tactile perception also showed some convergence with Powers\u2019 ideas.\nPCT proposes that many systems operating continuously and in parallel \u2013 this fits with how the nervous system is arranged.

By increasing the construction potential for ADUs, the City\u2019s goal of 10,000 homes between now and 2023 is more within reach.\nCity staff is recommending a number of proactive changes, including:\nLowering minimum lot sizes to 3,000 square feet (the current requirement is 5,445 square feet)\nIncreased square footage for ADUs based on lot size\nCreating additional flexibility around replacement parking\nAllowing second story units over garages\nSV@Home supports these changes, but sent a letter to the Council requesting that it:.\nIncorporate more flexibility around design and materials that allows for the installation of modular dwellings and other innovative housing construction.\nAllow up to two bedrooms for larger ADUs (given larger unit sizes allowed)\nIncrease the rear yard coverage requirements to 50% or 60% given the recommended increase in unit size and the reduction in lot size.\nAdjust the second story set back for existing zero lot line structures to conform to current setbacks.\nDevelop a deliberate engagement plan for units that are currently illegal.\nEliminate fees for ADUs to reduce costs and increase feasibility.\nEstablish a robust communications program.\nCreate a one-stop shop for ADUs, or a single point of contact to make it easier for residents who want to build an ADU but are challenged in navigating the complex development process.\nWe extend our gratitude"}]}

Radio and TV stations, as well as national and international community media organisations must consider funding, governance structures, changing political and economic conditions, while building, consolidating and extending relationships with their listening communities. The concept of sustainability has been widely used in the context of communication for development paradigms, as a lens for assessing the health and success of that sector. This special issue will provide an opportunity to reflect on questions of resilience and endurance as they arise in alternative, radical, oppositional, and community-grounded media, and to explore the various interdependent factors that can impact the ongoing stability and health of community media projects. Concurrently, the association of the term with questions of ecology prompts a reflective and ethical concern that extends beyond the immediate or parochial, and we expect papers that will, in a holistic fashion, explore the role and operation of the sector in the context of broader socio-political concerns. Community media have been the focus of an increasing amount of scholarly attention as they have grown in size, from social movement theorists, to political economists, to those focused on governance and organisational communication. As Atton and Hamilton (2008: 26) note in their analysis of the political economy of alternative journalism, the \u201cgeneral political-economic dilemma for any critical project is that it needs resources with which to work, but those crucial resources are present only in the very society that it seeks to change or dissolve.\u201d This special issue will build on existing knowledge, together with exploration of contemporary case studies, to explore the"}]}

Common themes are: (1) that the 'original causes' of an accident precede all other relevant events; (2) how to pick the temporal point of view from which the accident can be explained; (3) that it is a criterion of successful explanation that an assertion of the accident event should be logically derivable from assertions of preceding causally-relevant events; (4) that the causal relation is expressed by the tense-logical 'leads to' operator. Some authors have suggested (5) that an accident is explained by exhibiting the proof of the weak fairness of the accident-action. I have explained elsewhere (ad 2) how to pick a temporal point of view, and (ad 4) that causality is not suitably expressed by 'leads to'. I show here that the other three theses are implausible; that (1) may be rescued only at great cost to intuition and common practice; that (3) may be modified in the direction of a deductive-nomological model of explanation; and that (5), if at all worthy, has a much simpler equivalent. (HTML)\nExplaining Failure with Tense Logic\nAbstract: Accidents involve events, and events causing other events, laid out in time until the final disaster. Boolean logic alone is insufficient to describe such failure, although its use in the shape of fault trees has been very successful. Reasoning about objects and their properties is the domain of predicate logic, and reasoning about events and their temporal relations is the province of tense logic. I show how the reasoning involved in accident analysis may be formalised in tense logic, using the past-time operator since. I also show how a fault tree may be derived from a temporal logic description without use of frame axioms. I critique proposals to use purely future operators, and to identify the causality relation with a purely temporal logic operator. Finally, I consider the important concepts of interactive consistency and tight-coupling not to be worth formalising inside a tense logic.

Unfortunately, this fact does not come to light until the morning after Ivan spends the night in Marya's tent.\nWolfe's adjustments to the traditional fairy tale highlight some of the confusing and contradictory elements of the story. The addition of incest, while discomfiting, serves to poke gentle fun at the potential misunderstandings in a tale possessing two characters bearing the same name. It serves, as well, to reference a longstanding element of such behavior in Russian tales, and to explain the otherwise incomprehensible reasoning behind the original Ivan's encounter with Marya Morevna, their brief sojourn and their hasty marriage. In Wolfe's story, it quickly becomes clear that the marriage stems from convenience as much as anything else: neither party is willing to reveal the occurrence of the taboo to world, and the resulting birth of a child (also named Ivan, soon to be known as the Ivan the Simple) negates the possibility of ignoring it entirely.\nIn this story, too, Ivan the Bold frees Koshchei from captivity, but in a far less fancifully embroidered manner than found in the fairy tale. Ivan comes across a certain door in the dungeons of his sister's castle and opens it entirely out of idle curiosity. There he discovers Koshchei, condemned to starvation by the Countess. The prince frees him, feeds him, and then the two negotiate a treaty of peace to resolve the issues that had been the source of conflict between Koshchei and Marya. But when they set out to inform her of this happy news, Koshchei falls helplessly in love with her, and stages a revolt in order to carry Marya away with him. Her absence disturbs Prince Ivan not at all \u2014 his brotherly fondness having faded under the pressures of their new relationship \u2014 until he learns that the familial estate will revert back to the Holy Roman Empire unless he can furnish proof of Marya's continued existence.

In actuality, it appears there is no such thing in nature as a 100%-fruit frugivorous primate.\nFaunivory and folivory are the endpoints with frugivory intermediate. Pure faunivory and pure folivory reflect the two extremes of adaptation. However, as diets are a continuum, Chivers and Hladik argue that putting all intermediate diets in the (too broad) category of omnivores is inappropriate. They note [Chivers and Hladik 1984, p. 216]:\nNo mammal mixes large quantities of both animal matter and leaves in its diet without including fruit. Since faunivory and folivory seem to represent contrasting and incompatible [morphological] adaptations, the quantity of fruit in such a mixed diet is always considerable.\nThe objection of Chivers and Hladik to the term omnivore appears to reflect a different view of the definition of the term than is used by many other authors. This will be discussed later in this section.\nDetermining/measuring relevant gut characteristics is non-trivial. Chivers and Hladik [1980] includes a discussion of the major challenges involved in measuring the relevant gut parameters--volume, surface area, etc. Additional challenges include: the gut itself is elastic (i.e., it may stretch when you try to measure it), consists of irregular shapes which may be complicated by folds or specialized structures, and so on. In the real world, choosing what parameters to measure and how to measure them, in the area of gut morphology, is decidedly non-trivial. The simplistic comparative proofs of diet don't bother to tell you such details.\nBasic raw data collected: For the subject animals, the sizes of stomach, large intestine, and small intestine were all measured in terms of surface area, weight, and volume.

Ecology and evolution, 5(18), 4115-4131.\nConspicuous male coloration impairs survival against avian predators in Aegean wall lizards, Podarcis erhardii.\nAnimal coloration is strikingly diverse in nature. Within-species color variation can arise through local adaptation for camouflage, sexual dimorphism and conspicuous sexual signals, which often have conflicting effects on survival. Here, we tested whether color variation between two island populations of Aegean wall lizards (Podarcis erhardii) is due to sexual dimorphism and differential survival of individuals varying in appearance. On both islands, we measured attack rates by wild avian predators on clay models matching the coloration of real male and female P. erhardii from each island population, modeled to avian predator vision. Avian predator attack rates differed among model treatments, although only on one island. Male-colored models, which were more conspicuous against their experimental backgrounds to avian predators, were accordingly detected and attacked more frequently by birds than less conspicuous female-colored models. This suggests that female coloration has evolved primarily under selection for camouflage, whereas sexually competing males exhibit costly conspicuous coloration. Unexpectedly, there was no difference in avian attack frequency between local and non-local model types. This may have arisen if the models did not resemble lizard coloration with sufficient precision, or if real lizards behaviorally choose backgrounds that improve camouflage. Overall, these results show that sexually dimorphic coloration can affect the risk of predator attacks, indicating that color variation within a species can be caused by interactions between natural and sexual selection. However, more work is needed to determine how these findings depend on the island environment that each population inhabits.\nTrosci"}]}

The trail is wide enough for the bikers to overtake if you stick to the left.\nWe really enjoyed this walk and regret not discovering it sooner. Like most trails there are better times of the year than others to walk it. Winter and springtime are probably the best however it was quite shaded so it may be ok in summer except on a really hot day.\nThere is a small carpark with access from Burns Beach Road or you can park on the verge. There are no toilets but during sporting events at Windermere Oval you can access toilets and parking here.....it is only a few extra minutes walk from the trail head but you will have to cross Burns Beach Road.\nThe Yaberoo Budjara Heritage Trail follows the ancient Aboriginal migration route between Lake Joondalup and Loch McNess in Yanchep National Park.

Lara has been such an influence to me throughout my life, I think she\u2019s been such an iconic female in so many ways, not just to myself but to millions of fans across the globe. I think that with having such a strong woman in a game, growing up she was someone who I looked up to.\nI felt I could relate to her as she did her own thing and didn\u2019t let anything stop her from what she wanted to do. In my experience, because I had always been \u201aone of the boys\u2018, it was refreshing to be able to look up to such a woman who hadn\u2019t been created to shy away from anything, nor be just a token female that needed to be rescued. I\u2019d usually be running around the playground believing I was Lara Croft, dodging tigers, atlantean creatures and/or Larson or Pierre.\nMy favourite game will always be the original Tomb Raider (1996). As for the reasons above among many others, it was so groundbreaking for me. Not only was it incredibly challenging, you didn\u2019t have any other games like it back then. Nathan McCree\u2019s music is still incredible to this day, Shelley Blond\u2019s voice for Lara was just perfection, vocalised with the sharp wit that I still adore.

You really felt isolated and your path wasn\u2019t obvious as it is in most modern games. I do love the other Tomb Raider games, especially 1-6 as the characterization of Lara, for me, excels. I do enjoy the era of LAU, but the Core years will always be my favourite.\nYou are well-known within the fan community for making cross stitching with Tomb Raider motives.

Earth has the second highest ECS to albedo perturbations suggesting that the albedos of Mars, Titan and Triton might be more dynamic (less stable) on decadal-to-centennial time scales compared to the Earth\u2019s albedo.\nThe above estimate of Earth\u2019s ECS to total pressure (0.161 K/kPa) can be used to calculate the response of global surface temperature to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 compared to a preindustrial level of 280 ppm. According to the Nikolov-Zeller discovery about the adiabatic nature of the atmospheric thermal effect, a change in the amount of any gas in the atmosphere (including CO2) impacts global temperature only through the contribution of such a change to total surface air pressure. In other words, what matters for the global thermal environment at the surface is the partial pressure of gases, not their infrared radiative properties. Thus, a 280 ppm increase of atmospheric CO2 implies a 0.0276 kPa increase of surface air pressure (i.e. 98.55*280/106 = 0.0276 kPa). Multiplying this perturbation by the ECS to pressure yields the true response of our planet\u2019s global surface temperature to a CO2 doubling: 0.0276*0.161 = 0.0044 K. This amount of global warming is practically undetectable. Hence, current climate models overestimate the Earth\u2019s global temperature sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 about 682 times or by 68,100% on average (i.e. 3.0/0.0044 = 681.8).\nDerivation of exact analytical formulas for estimating the equilibrium climate sensitivities of planetary bodies to shortwave radiative forcing and surface atmospheric pressure was possible thanks to a new robust model of global surface temperature inferred from NASA planetary data by Nikolov & Zeller (2017). The model provides novel insights about the role of albedo in climate and into the physical nature of the Atmospheric Therm"}]}

When I first read Don Mee\u2019s translations in Circumference Magazine nearly a decade ago, I turned to the then au courant digital media of message boards and list servs to try to track her down. Susan Schultz, poet and editor of Hawaii\u2019s TinFish Press, finally acquainted us. Don Mee was receptive but possibly a little alarmed to hear how ardently Johannes and I, the editors of a new press, Action Books, wanted to work with her to bring a volume of her Kim Hyesoon translations to US readers. We have since brought out four titles, each featuring exciting selections of Kim\u2019s work alongside interviews, prefaces, and essays\u2014all translated, selected, and compiled by Don Mee Choi. In many ways, Kim Hyesoon\u2019s body of work in English is actually a kind of double, a non-identical twin volatilely and unstably conjoined with her Korean body of work, constantly morphing in shape and tone, uncannily vivified by the double supply of artistry that runs between Kim Hyesoon and Don Mee Choi.\nSince our first volume, Mommy Must be a Fountain of Feathers (2008), which was in fact proceeded by various journal and anthology publications and TinFish\u2019s deceptively demure pink chapbook, When the Plug Comes Unplugged (2005) as well as a substantial selection in Don Mee Choi\u2019s groundbreaking Anxiety of Words (Zephyr Press, 2006), Kim Hyesoon\u2019s English influence has actively contaminated the zone of US poetry, finding fans across the spectrum from novice poetry students to US Poet Laureate Robert Hass. On the strength of Don Mee Choi\u2019s translations, Kim Hyesoon has expanded her European and global readership. As a sign of her global prominence, Kim Hyesoon was invited to read with Nobel Laureates Seamus Heaney and Wole Soyinka during the Poetry Parnassus which preceded the London Olympics in 2012.

The area is famous for its glow worm studded caves and the dark, hidden underground caverns and streams. The above-ground landscape also has deep hideaways in dense bush for wild game.

In addition, Ketamine had a very rapid response rate, with many patients noting a dramatic elevation in mood and dissipation of depression symptoms within a few hours to a few days, compared to response rates of several weeks with the standard drugs. This may be because the glutamate neurological pathways respond much more rapidly to medications than the serotonin and dopamine neurological pathways which are influenced by standard antidepressants.\nKetamine infusions create a cascade of events in the brain that affects certain neurotransmitter receptors and neurological pathways, and triggers rapid growth of normal neural conditions. This rewiring of the brain is thought to be the basis of the antidepressant effect. In addition, Ketamine is a powerful anti-inflammatory medication. Since depression has been linked to chronic inflammation, this may also be a part of its antidepressant effect. This may be why some patients achieve long-term relief after just one infusion or one short series of infusions. Others will find that Ketamine infusions enhanced with oral medicines, lifestyle changes and other choices will dramatically reduce depression symptoms.\nEveryone reacts differently to medications of all kinds, so we customize treatments, including frequency and dosage, specifically to your requirements. Research shows that 70% to 80% of patients have experienced significant relief for treatment of depression using Ketamine infusions.\nWe know that typical antidepressants work well in only 30% to 40% of patients with depression.

When I hear it, I think only of New York City, often wondering how it got that nickname. As it turns out, author and NYC native Washington Irving, of Icabod Crane fame, made the association over 120 years ago.\nIrving published a satirical periodical, Salmagundi, in which he wrote articles that poked fun at and lampooned the city and its more eccentric residents. He learned of a medieval English village called Gotham, meaning \u201cgoat town\u201d, whose inhabitants conspired to keep a king from bringing chaos and higher taxes to the home they loved. An ancient folk tale called The Wise Men of Gotham likely served as Irving\u2019s inspiration. While Batman\u2019s Gotham is a dark, dangerous, and brooding place, Irving\u2019s couldn\u2019t have been more different.\nThe legend relates how, when King John planned to build a hunting lodge in their woods, Gotham\u2019s residents greeted a planning visit from the king\u2019s knights by feigning madness. They took turns doing things like trying to drown an eel in their pond and fencing in a bush to prevent a cuckoo from escaping. A man was seen carrying 2 bushels of grain on his back while leading his horse, telling everyone that the bushels were too heavy for the horse to carry. Madness being considered highly contagious, the knights soon left to advise the king to look elsewhere for a building site.\nIn 1907, Washington Irving adopted the name Gotham for NYC. New Yorkers embraced it, and it stuck. As for Gotham, which was originally pronounced Goat-um, that town has a Cuckoo Bush inn, Cuckoo Bush Mound, and a weathervane with a Batman figure on it.\nAmericanEnglandHistorymedievalNew Yorktradition\n4 thoughts on \u201cWhy NYC is Called Gotham\u201d\nThe Chronicles of History says:\nVery interesting read!\nkatknit says:\nThanks!

The rationale is to improve blood flow to the injured brain and prevent secondary ischemia.\nAB - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The intent of this manuscript is to summarize the pathophysiologic basis for hemodynamic manipulation in subarachnoid hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury, highlight the most recent literature and present expert opinion on indications and use. RECENT FINDINGS: Hemodynamic augmentation with vasopressors and inotropes along with hypervolemia are the mainstay of treatment of vasospasm due to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Considerable variation continues to exist regarding fluid management and the use of vasopressors and inotropes. Blood pressure augmentation, volume expansion and cardiac contractility enhancement improve cerebral blood flow in ischemic areas, ameliorate vasospasm and improve clinical condition. In patients suffering from severe traumatic brain injury, while every attempt is made to control intracranial hypertension, cerebral perfusion-directed therapy with fluids and vasopressors is also used to keep cerebral perfusion pressure above 60-70 mmHg. Yet, recent observations suggest that posttraumatic mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed as an alternative explanation for lower cerebral blood flow after acute trauma. SUMMARY: Hemodynamic manipulation is routinely used in the management of patients with acute vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage and severe head injury. The rationale is to improve blood flow to the injured brain and prevent secondary ischemia.\nKW - Cerebral perfusion pressure\nKW - Cerebral vasospasm\nKW - Hemodynamic augmentation\nKW - Subarachnoid hemorrhage\nU2 - 10.1097/MCC.0b013e32807f2aa5\nDO - 10.1097/MCC.0b013e32807f2aa5\nJO - Current Opinion in Critical Care\nJF - Current Opinion in Critical Care\nDiringer MN"}]}

Assessing effects of neurotoxic pollutants by biochemical markers. Environmental Research 85 : 31-36 (2001).\nThis article reviews the efficacy and limitations of current neurotoxicity biomarkers. Toxic biochemical changes often occur at the cellular/subcellular level before overt nervous system disease manifests. These changes may serve as markers of neurotoxicity in exposed populations. Complexity of nervous system functions, the multistage nature of neurotoxic events, and inaccessibility of target tissues pose obstacles to the use of biomarkers. However, new techniques have been established to assess exposure, effect and susceptibility to neurotoxic disease. Surrogate markers for nervous tissue are found in peripheral tissues. Presently, ALAD, AchE, and MAO are used as biomarkers of exposure to lead, organophosphates, and Mn/styrene respectively. The use of peripheral biomarkers is limited to agents whose mechanism of action is known, and is based upon the assumption that peripheral tissues have the same pharmacological properties as nervous system targets, and therefore are affected by neurotoxins in a similar way. This must be validated by mechanistic studies. Differences in dose-response and adaptation may occur. Markers detecting early neurotoxic changes may be effective as tools for identifying subclinical disease states and initial neurotoxic effects. Their development could play a critical role in occupational and preventative medicine. In combination with neurobe"}]}

Phosphorus can be acquired from inorganic but natural sources such as rock phosphorus, or organic sources like bone meal. Soil pH needs to be below 7.0 for the phosphorus in bone meal to be available to plant roots.\nMany organic nutrients, such as bat guano and fish or chicken fertilizer, are high in phosphorus and have more rapid uptake profiles. Sea minerals and liquid seaweed are other organic sources of readily available phosphorus.\nSee: Soup Up Your Soil with Molasses, Guano, and Kelp\nThere are two primary categories for phosphorus availability: water soluble and citrate soluble. (You can find additional information on how phosphorus works, available sources, and how to improve plant uptake by following the link at the end of this article.)\nOrganic phosphorous fertilizers have been used for a very long time as the primary source for crops. Even with the advent of new phosphorous fertilizer technology, organic sources from animal manures\u2014including composts\u2014are still very important.\nFrom a fertilizer nutrient perspective, the primary difference is the availability of phosphorus from the fertilizer. As with most of the fertilizer products, especially those with varying analysis, additional chemical analysis should be done to determine an availability coefficient as a portion of the reported total phosphorus.\nSee: Organic Nutrients for a Sustainable Tomorrow\nPhosphorus contained in organic sources is a combination of inorganic and organic. Essentially, everything inorganic is in the orthophosphate form. The combination of the organic and inorganic phosphorous ratios in various organic sources and the soil environment will affect the availability for organic phosphorus.\nMost animal manure research interpretations indicate that approximately 60 to 80 per cent of the total phosphorus is available to crops in the first year.

In fact, quite the opposite was true.\nAlthough in a different context to the previous campaign, taking precautions and applying the health measures implemented in 2021, the harvest took place under more normal conditions and with a reduction in quantity of somewhere around 25 %, although with major variations depending on the area and the variety.\n"}]}

A young man was sitting alone in a table-for-four. He had placed himself on the aisle and had his feet on the seat opposite, effectively blocking access to the other two seats. Across the aisle was a \u2018mature\u2019 lady similarly spread across two seats from the aisle where her butt actually was. In the disabled area a young woman had filled the extra foot space with shopping bags and was sitting cross-legged on one seat, sideways, while she used the other seat as a cross between a social-media hub and office. The conductor came through asking for tickets, and said nothing. A community police officer came through and said nothing. It seems that those with the brass neck to \u2018claim\u2019 as much space as they want rely on the British reticence to cause a fuss and the fear of being embroiled in an altercation: people getting on further down the line passed by looking for a seat and opted to stand.

Distribution agreements typically include trademark licensing terms, exclusivity or nonexclusivity provisions, marketing terms, descriptions of the geographic region covered and provisions for the length of the contract.\nTermination Clause and Negotiation\nThe easiest way to terminate a distribution agreement with minimal rancor is to include a termination clause that covers the basis for termination, the reason for termination, amount of required advance notice and any compensation either party must pay. The provisions must clearly specify termination dates -- for example, two years from today\u2019s date -- and whether or not the distribution agreement terminates upon breach of a particular term in the contract. If the agreement incorporates a \u201ctermination upon breach\u201d clause, that clause must also include clear details about what constitutes a breach, requirements regarding notices of breach and time to cure the breach.\nNegotiation in Absence of Termination Clause\nIf no termination clause and no serious contractual breach exist, the parties should attempt to negotiate a revision or amendment to the distribution agreement. Negotiating indicates that although circumstances have changed, the party initiating the amendment still values the relationship. Perhaps the distributor has not met sales targets or has not properly marketed the product. Or perhaps the distributor has a high number of product returns and customer complaints. Working as partners to address these issues increases the likelihood that a workable solution may appear. Even if a solution does not appear, the likelihood that the agreement terminates without escalating to attorney involvement and lawsuits increases.\nEnding the Agreement\nThe party that intends to terminate must provide as much notice as possible. Some states require as much as a 90-day notice in the absence of a specific termination clause. This protects a distributor who may have invested in marketing, sales force hires and warehouse space to service the manufacturer. If the terminating party is doing so because of poor performance or a shift in strategy, it should offer a financial remedy to the other to compensate. This could be a lump sum or a series of payments over time.\nAssociate of Corporate Counsel: Terminating Distribution Agreements -\u2013 Know Where You Stand\nKeeley"}]}

The configurations of model components are listed in Supplementary Table S2. The meteorological inputs are derived from climatological simulations performed using the Community Earth System Model (CESM), which was downscaled using the WRF model (40, 41). In the present study, we performed simulations for a historical year (\u201c2004\u201d) and for a future year (\u201c2047\u201d); the two years were selected as representative of the climatological conditions in the beginning and middle of the 21st century. It should be noted that the meteorological information in the simulations was not intended to exactly \u201cmatch\u201d these actual meteorological years, since the climatological simulations were performed without assimilating daily local weather observations (40). The pollen transport and fate model CMAQ-Pollen was adapted from version 4.7.1 of the CMAQ modeling system (42, 43). Pollen grains are treated as inert coarse mode aerosol and physical properties such as density, diameter and diameter distributions and other related information (e.g., cutoff maximum aerosol diameter) of the coarse mode are incorporated in the relevant CMAQ modules (AERO5), so that the CMAQ-Pollen model can properly describe pollen dynamics. Specifically, pollen grains are modeled by adding to the existing coarse mode and assuming it is fully mixed with other coarse aerosols (e.g., agricultural and wind-blown dust, sea spray). The CMAQ modules describe diameter of each coarse aerosol via a lognormal distribution (44). Due to data limitation, we assume the means of pollen diameters to be fixed (oak\u2009=\u200928\u2005\u03bcm and ragweed\u2009=\u200918\u2005\u03bcm for both historical and future years) and set relevant parameters (such as pollen density) the same as those used in our emission model (16).

If you keep the appliance according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommended settings and maintenance timeline, the manufacturer expects it to live a certain amount of time without any issues. A major appliance that fails within the warranty period is defective. Thus, most manufacturers replace without too much hassle to the consumer.\nPipes are major engineering feats. Even an Orangeburg pipe has a lifespan of 50 years. Cast iron, cement, and PVC pipes last between 75 to 100 years.\nSeptic systems consist of five components including the tank, drain lines, and pump. The septic lifespan depends on the component.

Such defects arise due to imperfect packing during the original crystallisation or they may arise from thermal vibrations of atoms at elevated temperatures.\nExplain Schottky defect.\nThe schottky defect arises due to the missing of an equal number of cations and anions from the crystal lattice. This effect does not change the stoichiometry of the crystal. Ionic solids in which the cation and anion are of almost similar size show Schottky defect.\nExample: NaCl.\nPresence of large number of schottky defects in a crystal, lowers its density. For example, the theoretical density of vanadium monoxide (VO) calculated using the edge length of the unit cell is 6.5 g cm-3 but the actual experimental density is 5.6 gcm3. It indicates that there is approximately 14% Schottky defect in VO crystal. Presence of Schottky defect in the crystal provides a simple way by which atoms or ions can move within the crystal lattice.\nWrite short note on metal excess and metal deficiency defect with an example. Metal excess defect.\nMetal excess defect arises due to the presence of more number of metal ions as compared to anions.Alkali metal halides NaCl, KCl show this type of defect.The electrical neutrality of the crystal can be maintained by the presence of anionic vacancies equal to the excess metal ions (or) by the presence of extra cation and electron present in interstitial position.\nFor example, when NaCl crystals are heated in the presence of sodium vapour, Na+ ions are formed and are deposited on the surface of the crystal.

It would talk about the difficult choices we need to make as a society about the environment, public services, demographics and more, and the balance between short-term populism and long-term gain.

The collimator jaws have independent motion, so that an aperture of variable width is scanned across the field. The algorithm has the form of a constrained optimization problem and jaw motions are optimized such that the treatment time for the field at a given dose rate is minimized. The application and results of this technique are presented, and it is shown that this approach provides an efficient practical implementation of conformal radiotherapy plans based on the use of intensity-modulated fields.

Non-contaminated concrete waste is assumed to be disposed in a landfill site, but that will not be the solution especially in the future, because of decreasing tendency of the site availability and natural resources. Concerning concrete recycling, demand for roadbeds and backfill tends to be less than the amount of dismantled concrete generated in a single rural site, and conventional recycled aggregate is limited of its use to non-structural concrete, because of its inferior quality to ordinary natural aggregate. Therefore, it is vital to develop high quality recycled aggregate for general uses of dismantled concrete. If recycled aggregate is available for high structural concrete, the dismantling concrete is recyclable as aggregate for industry including nuclear field. Authors developed techniques on high quality aggregate reclamation for large amount of concrete generated during NPP decommissioning. Concrete of NPP buildings has good features for recycling aggregate; large quantity of high quality aggregate from same origin, record keeping of the aggregate origin, and little impurities in dismantled concrete such as wood and plastics. The target of recycled aggregate in this development is to meet the quality criteria for NPP concrete as prescribed in JASS 5N 'Specification for Nuclear Power Facility Reinforced Concrete' and JASS 5 'Specification for Reinforced Concrete Work'. The target of recycled aggregate concrete is to be comparable performance with ordinary aggregate concrete. The high quality recycled aggregate production techniques are assumed to apply for recycling for large amount of non-contaminated concrete.

Kyle Davidson believes that Korchinski would be more valuable than Alex Debrincat in the long term... And this, as it has been speculated already, will Davidson's first major gamble of his career and the one that will forever determine his success as general manager.\nSure, there is a lot to like about Korchinski. He skates amazingly, is an offensive dynamo on defense, takes hits like a champ, has height, and projects to be a top-two defenseman. However, that is not what he will be expected to be for the Blackhawks fan base... Most likely. When you trade a superstar in what is honestly a one-for-one deal for a prospect, the prospect will be expected to offer as much if not more for the team. Korchinski will be expected to be a number 1 defenseman for the Blackhawks who can dominate on both ends of the ice.\nKyle Davidson has decided to build a team that follows his vision: Fast, high work ethic, and responsible on both ends of the ice. He has allowed Dylan Strome and Dominik Kubalik to walk because they don't fit the new identity. With that said... Alex Debrincat did fit the mold here but we know that he was, after Patrick Kane, the Blackhawks' most valuable piece. Everyone expected more in a return for Debrincat... But all the Blackhawks really got was Kevin Korchinski.\nI will be rooting for the kid like every Blackhawks fan, but I will also have high expectations and expect Korchinski to develop into a Cale Makar type defenseman with comparable impact.

Various state anti-discrimination laws have ruined Christian wedding businesses with large fines and legal fees, and also led to many others receiving abuse from LGBT activists.\nThe issue is now before the US Supreme Court in Masterpiece Cakeshop v.

At the same time, CV remains low, which implies reasonable precision of detecting differences from zero. This is because the within-person variance is still relatively low in comparison to the means (see right panel of Figure 2).\nEach plot shows simulated data of 10 repeated measurements of a fictitious outcome X for five persons.\nWithin-person variance is identical over persons and panels. Left panel: Between-person variance is identical to within-person variance. In that case, ICC-indexed reliability is estimated at a rather low ICC = 0.48, whereas CV-indexed precision is fair, with averaged CV = 0.07. Right panel: Between-person standard deviation is larger than within-person standard deviation by a factor of five. In this condition, estimated ICC-indexed reliability is high (ICC = 0.96), but CV-indexed precision remains identical with averaged CV = 0.07 as the within-person standard deviation is still fairly small with respect to the sample mean.\nIn summary, whereas the CV refers to the precision of measurement obtained from each object, the ICC expresses a part-whole relation of variance observed in the data. All other things being equal, a less precise measurement will increase the variance-within, and hence compromise our ability to detect between-person differences. On the other hand, a rather imprecise measurement (as indexed by the CV obtained for each object of measurement) may nevertheless yield high reliability (as indexed by the ICC) if the between-person differences in means are large.\nIntra-class effect decomposition (ICED)\nThe extant neuroimaging literature typically offers little justification for the choice"}]}

When it's in the really bad flared up stage, that's where I'm going to tell them \"Don't do that.\" But as they begin to get a little bit more movement, I'm going to do exactly what you said, just tell them to push the envelope a little bit, but we don't want to do it when it's really in that flared up stage because that will, a lot of times, increase the neural sensitivity.\nWell, basic inflammation approaches, meaning if it's inflamed, we treat it carefully. And this isn't the place, and, like you said, to stimulate or increase, willy-nilly at least, the inflammation. We want to calm it. We want to increase the adaptive range around it.

That's a nice, objective measure of improvement that really stimulates positive thought and positive momentum about making progress in there.\nWell, it gives another marker besides just, \"It hurts,\" too.

We follow the life of Sparrowhawk, whose true name in the Old Language is Ged, and in the magic world of Earthsea true names have power. By knowing the true name of a creature or a thing you can enchant it, or control it.\nAs we follow Ged from childhood through troublesome adolescence, to his apprenticeship with the Wizard Ogion and his tutelage at the School of Wizards on Roke, he finds himself on a quest to defeat the shadow that has plagued him since an I\u2019ll-advised magical pissing contest with a fellow student unleashed it into the world. And the shadow knows Ged\u2019s name.\nThis book is wonderful. A short read at just 161 pages in length, it has deceptively simple linear narrative, and magnificent world building that sucks you in to Earthsea, with its archipelago of islands, complex and highly functioning trade routes, and deep respect for magic and the role of wizards. Whilst we see many villages as we travel with Ged, the inhabitants are largely left to do their own thing in the background, and our protagonist is one of only 3 characters that are given the space to grow in this right and deftly written masterpiece.\nAnd, speaking of the writing \u2026 woah.

This subset of adjunct faculty is fulfilling a critical role in the higher education landscape, yet the variability of these appointments makes it exceedingly difficult to assess their needs and, ultimately, provide adequate support.\nIn 2017, COACHE partners at the University at Buffalo set out to address this knowledge gap by adapting the Faculty Job Satisfaction Survey to suit the needs of their part-time faculty.

By defining the benefits he will receive, Abigail Adams hopes that it will incline John Quincy Adams to earnestly participate in the voyage and prosper.\nAbigail Adam also uses allusion to strengthen her overall argument.

This can act as both a blessing and a curse, as the metal handles of these pans are incredibly hot when used in an oven or broiler. With this in mind, it\u2019s essential to be mindful of a cast iron\u2019s handles and use oven mitts or something similar when holding it.\nBest cast iron pans\nSome top choices for cast iron skillets include the Victoria Cast Iron Frying Pan and the Lodge Seasoned Cast Iron 3 Skillet Bundle. The Victoria skillet has two side handles for easy handling and a spout to help with excess grease. The Lodge Cast Iron Skillet Bundle is an excellent choice for those looking for a cast iron set. The 8-, 10.5- and 12-inch skillets ensure maximum versatility for all types of dishes.\nStainless steel pans\nStainless steel is one of the most popular materials for cookware today. It\u2019s made through cladding, in which layers of metal (typically aluminum or copper) are bonded together to help heat evenly conduct throughout the cookware.\nLike cast iron pans, stainless steel pans are incredibly durable. Additionally, the pans contain chromium, which creates a passive layer of oxide on its exterior surface, ensuring protection against things like scratching or corrosion.\nWhat you\u2019ll love about stainless steel pans\nStainless steel pans are extremely versatile. They can be used to cook just about everything from breakfast options like eggs and bacon to dinners like meats and sauteed vegetables. Stainless steel pans are considered non-reactive, unlike cast iron pans, which means acidic foods like sauces and wine will not damage the exterior. Additionally, they can be used in any situation, from stovetop to oven use.\nUnlike cast iron pans, stainless steel pans don\u2019t need to be seasoned to be cleaned. They can be easily cleaned with soap and water and are usually dishwasher-safe.\nQuick heating\nSince they have a layered metal construction, stainless steel pans heat quickly."}]}

But, unfortunately I have some concerns.\nFirst of all, Dr. Fauci said that he got on a plane and went to the North Pole to give Santa Claus the vaccine himself.

You could, of course, use a store-bought white frosting for the edge of the cake, but since you only need a small amount of frosting, the clone recipe here makes it cheaper.\nThe hazelnuts are candied with sugar and reduced to crumbs in a food processor. You can find a 1/2-cup bag of chopped hazelnuts in most supermarkets that are perfect for this. And two 15-ounce cans of mandarin orange wedges is just the right amount for garnishing the top.

The usual objection is that it is too difficult to do well. Hands\u2019 prefers a deeper objection: there are \u201cno rational grounds\u201d for determining whether or not patriotism does more harm than good. Schools can therefore do no more than teach patriotism as a controversial subject, and allow pupils to decide for themselves. Hands\u2019 utilitarian case for staying on the fence on the value of patriotism as a social good is unconvincing. If we want civic, not ethnic, versions of national identity to underpin our common citizenship, then this depends on being in favour of the version of patriotism and belonging that we need. Most attention is given to the argument that patriotism clouds and impedes the judgement of citizens to do their civic duty, yet there has never been any shortage of projects for change \u2013 from Wilberforce and Equino\u2019s movement to abolish slavery, the US civil rights movement, or the \u201cnow win the peace\u201d case for post-war welfare \u2013 founded in patriotic critiques of the status quo.\nMost who think patriotism is worth getting off the fence for will also agree that the author\u2019s objection to patriotic indoctrination in schools is valid. But how many contemporary voices are promoting a tub-thumping and biased account of British history to re-establish or invent national myths? That would certainly be an unfair caricature of Education Secretary Michael Gove. His argument for an overarching sense of the narrative sweep of British history is surely compatible with teaching it, warts and all.

From this, one can easily derive a polynomial-time algorithm for sorting signed circular permutations by SSOs: it suffices to cut the circular permutation (n different cuts are possible), and to decide which extremity is left and which is right (2 possible cases). Once this is done, we are left with a linear permutation, which can be sorted using cyclic SSOs using Algorithm 1. The sorting distance is the minimum value obtained by Algorithm 1 over the 2n possible linear permutations obtained from the circular one. Thus we have the following result.\nSorting signed circular permutations by SSOs is in \\(\\mathsf {P}.\\)\nComputing a sorting sequence\nAlgorithm 1 only returns the length of a minimum-length sorting sequence, not the sequence itself.

For this, we iteratively remove each edge from \\(G^X_{\\pi }\\) by applying a swap over two adjacent elements connected by an edge, and choosing between a 2-reversal or a 2-transposition so that the number of odd components does not increase, as shown in Lemma 3.

Studies show that both the transition to higher education and from higher education to work pose certain difficulties for them. At the same time, the aim is to promote the diversity of higher education and a smoother work transition. The support of the universities has been found to promote both the progress of studies and skills important in studies. The purpose of this Master\u2019s thesis was to look at speech related to support for students on the autism spectrum at universities. The research material consisted of six interviews in which two career services employees, two university teachers, and both current and graduate students on the autism spectrum were interviewed. The interviews were originally part of the Improving Employability of Autistic Graduates in Europe (IMAGE) project. The six interviews were selected for use in this thesis together with the researcher involved in the project. The research material was analyzed by discourse analysis. As a result of the analysis, three discourses were outlined, which were named similarization discourse, individualization discourse, and individualistic discourse. The subject positions of students on the autism spectrum transitioning to work, were outlined through substance- and special skills and without individualistic agency. These subject positions did not fully meet the individualistic expectations of employers, or the support formed based on these expectations.\nKorkeakouluopiskelijoiden uupumuksen ehk\u00e4iseminen psykologisen joustavuuden avulla \ufeff\nPoranen, Nea (2022)\nMore and more university students are experiencing symptoms of burnout.

From what I got back then, he was out of his depth if and when he ever talked about that sort of stuff.

This is true in dolphins, a creature that we generally think of as happy, possibly because of the structure of their jaws that seem locked in a permanent smile. We picture dolphins being playful, jumping in and out of the water. However, this seemingly playful activity can actually be an aggressive behavior. When dolphins leap out of the ocean, it is often because they are fighting with other dolphins and breaking the water surface at high speeds to breathe. But there are other things that dolphins do that scientists believe are forms of play, such as riding on waves for no functional reason or passing around organic objects like seaweed, fish or sea turtles.\nSimilar behavior can be play in animals other than mammals. Fish, frogs and reptiles can have fun. Fish can leap over objects in the water for fun, frog tadpoles ride bubbles, adult frogs sometimes wrestle each other without sexual intentions, and komodo dragons, turtles, and crocodiles play with objects in ways similar to dogs.\nGiven the established role that play seems to have on mammals and other critters, it is surprising to think that invertebrates can also indulge in play. Previously, invertebrates were considered unintelligent and incapable of higher-level actions exhibited by animals with backbones. Yet, an ideal example of play in invertebrates is seen among cephalopods. Octopuses can be seen acting in an exploratory way towards objects by using their arms or siphons to move objects around or playing catch-and-release with their prey the same way a cat would with a mouse. Spiders, another invertebrate, have also been observed exhibiting play behavior. They also engage in non-functional sexual behavior that does not result in conception. At the moment, these observations are preliminary evidence to the argument that invertebrates, too, can play.\nSo why do these animals play? Play can stimulate creative behavior and is hypothesized to have originated when species developed the metabolic capacity as well as increased time and safety for extended activity without functional benefits.

With space at a premium at the back of an F1 car, compromises in packaging the various suspension elements need to be made. At its launch it was clear the Mercedes pull rod arrangement placed the rocker quite rearward, in comparison to other pull rod arrangements which place the rocker towards the front of the gear case. The conventional forward rocker placement, puts the heave spring and antiroll in the space at the front of the gear case, packaged around the clutch.\nIn Mercedes case the rocker is packaged the other side of the gear cluster, just under the gearboxes cross shaft. This leaves little room for the antiroll bar and heave spring. It does however place the rocker and torsion bars very low for the benefit of packaging, aero and CofG. Albeit these are small benefits, perhaps Mercedes choice of a short wheel base did not leave space for the suspension to be packaged around the clutch, as the gearbox length is a critical factor in wheelbase length.\nSo left with the lack of space to place either a mechanical heave element or a antiroll bar, it appears that Mercedes have opted to create a passive hydraulic system. This is not to be confused with any form of active suspension or the cars high pressure hydraulic systems, this system will be entirely self contained to remain within the rules on suspension design. As the system reacts only to suspension loads, it is clearly legal and there is no question of interpretation in its acceptance by the FIA.\nWhat Mercedes have in place of a conventional anti roll bar and heave spring are hydraulics units (yellow), which probably also act as the dampers.

The finding is promising from a public health policy perspective because misuse of prescription opioids annually contributes to more than 10,000 overdose deaths.\nTwenty-one U.S. states have passed recreational cannabis laws and legislatures in other states are considering similar measures.\n\u201cA reduction in the misuse of opioids will save lives,\u201d said doctoral candidate Shyam Raman who is affiliated with the Cornell Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy and the lead author. \u201cOur research indicates that recreational cannabis laws substantially reduce distribution of codeine to pharmacies, an overlooked potential benefit to legalizing recreational cannabis use.\u201d\nThe study is believed to be among the first to separately examine the impact of recreational cannabis laws on shipments of opioids to hospitals, pharmacies and other endpoint distributors.

The company says it wants the ES7 to feel like \u201ca second living room,\u201d though it might well have better speakers and lighting than your own, unless you happen to have a 256-color digital waterfall of ambient lighting.

Manga genres can be roughly divided by age and gender of the reader, such as boys, girls, young adult, men, women, etc. Also, there are various genres by subject such as action, sci-fi, horror, mystery, love, comedy. . . and food. Often known as gourmet or cooking manga, this genre has become one of the popular genres. Although food is the central theme, the gourmet manga works are diverse and across different genres. Works can be comedy, action, romance, and/or history.\nCooking/Gourmet manga often focuses on a chef, those who cook food in restaurants. So, in this sense, they are manga for professionals who devote their lives to cooking. For example, Aji ichi monme depicts the growth process of a young chef working in a Japanese restaurant. When two chefs are in a contest against each other, the cooking/gourmet manga can be the story of battle. Boys manga depicts food battle stories which sometimes become ridiculously wild. As shown in Yakitate!! Japan, young, genius bread makers show off their extraordinary technique, which is often beyond the ability of human being, who create innovative food which tastes unworldly. The story may also focus on those who eat. The epicurean journalist in Oishinbo does not hesitate to reveal their deep knowledge of food ingredients, thereby providing the readers with the educational information on food. Some manga use food as communication tool. While depicting the daily life of the characters, the story shows what they cook and how they dine together, usually with the recipe of the featured meal. One extraordinary cookbook manga is Danjon-meshi, a fantasy manga which explains how to cook monsters living in a dungeon.
